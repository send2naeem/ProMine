Redesign
Substantial changes were made to the materials as a result of these discussions Premiums and coverage levels were also confirmed CARE provided a six month fixed subsidy to each RBMFI to cover the cost of one Personal Insurance Advisor two PIAs at one MFI while they built a client list with premium commissions sufficient to cover at least the cost of the PIA In fact most RB MFIs used the money as a general operating subsidy and offered little time for sales Although targets were set there was no link between productivity and payment This has created a problem for the insurer who will soon take over the direct relationships with these RBMFIs and will be expecting productivity Staff training was intensive All relevant staff received basic product training and two sales people from each institution were extensively trained on basic insurance insurance sales and managing the software Results show that to be effective training should be almost completely experience based with role plays and other hands on techniques Lack of sales productivity and difficulties using the software have led GLICO to consider placing a professional agent within each of the RB MFIs for a month to directly mentor the PIAs and other staff
