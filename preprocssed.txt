residence lived cause insured loss. coverage terms vary among insurers, important review policy call insurer agent questions. three coverages called additional living expense, fair rental value and, states, prohibited use. limit liability loss use shown declarations page total aggregate limit se three nefits. additional living expense - covered loss results residence premises unfit live in, insurer cover necessary increase living expenses allow household maintain normal standard living. payment least amount time necessary repair replace damage or, named insured permanently relocate, least amount time required household settle location. example, assume house en partially damaged fire. cause extensive damage, policyholder forced move rental apartment temporary basis. ir rent , per month, addition policyholder s , mortgage payment, continue pay. thus, , rent considered additional living expenses. policyholder s food costs averaged little higher y fore fire, additional amount

comparable residence available. addition, expenses decrease result loss, utility expenses, subtracted additional charges. note coverage payable damage caused insured peril. house uninhabitable flood, peril typically excluded homeowners policy, loss use coverage apply. and, federal flood insurance specifically excludes additional living expense coverage. important point concerns time necessary repair replace damage. example, home repaired within six weeks, policyholder unnecessarily delays moving rented accommodations, extra rent delay covered. fair rental value - covered loss renders portions premises rented s uninhabitable, insurer cover fair rental value premises. however, expenses continue reduced home uninhabitable subtracted additional expenses. payment least amount time necessary repair replace part premises rented s. example, assume policyholder owns large home rents one rooms per month, includes utilities. fire renders entire house, including rented room, unfit live in. insurer cover rental value less expenses continue e.g., electricity damage repaired. suppose takes two months repair damage. tenant s utility share usually per month, n insurer pay - x months . time necessary repair replace damage key factor. home determined repairable within two months, policyholder unnecessarily causes delays start-up construction resulting two-week lag, insurer cover extra two-week rental value. again, note coverage payable damage caused insured peril. house uninhabitable flood, peril typically excluded homeowners policy, loss use coverage apply. prohibited use - civil authority, federal, state, local government agency state police, prohibit residents accessing ir undamaged homes damaged neighborhood community. civil authority include federal, state, local

particularly lease agreement stipulated allowable se circumstances. example, assume fire damaged policyholder s home, rendering uninhabitable. result, policyholder s tenant moved canceled lease, took policyholder additional two months repairs completed find tenant. homeowners insurance policy provide coverage se two months lost rental revenue. provides coverage time repairs completed covered loss

rundschau der versicherungen, , p . already called attention misleading principle estimating present value obligations lower interest rate present value yet collected premiums demonstrated consequences misleading calculations balance sheet company thus calculates. yet since time, practically nothing happened prevent use misleading principle. re, one finds professional journals remark reserve figured gross premiums small, one finds. recent times, prompted publication balance sheets english companies, voices en raised mischief se calculations. this, aspects life insurance business en drawn conversation and, re, mistaken concepts come widely shared. example, asserted recent custom paying agents high commission acquisition life insurance contract, insured amount, seems make impossible set actuarially sound reserve. thus companies pay commissions forced calculate reserves low, even according principle gross premiums. presentation mistaken, intentionally misleading assertions, well suited deeply affect trust public life insurance companies harm exactly companies published ir business details greatest openness make secret ir commissions. attempt contribute, st ability, correct view reserves life insurance companies first segment following monograph provide proof even custom closing commission, reserve established completely calculable magnitude. second segment, briefly discuss method calculation gross premiums, lieve reby show phenomena existing real world natural consequences misleading system. i. life insurance institution, reserve plays large role. annual premium insurance policy mind usual whole life insurance policy annual premium payment remains constant whole term insurance policy risk insured amount comes death insured grows year. insurance policy always issued one year only, require increase premium year. refore premium remains constant whole term insurance policy greater first year issue insurance policy yearly renewable term yrt premium later premium smaller yrt premium. certain num r persons enter insurance bank, n bank create considerable surplus covering occurring cases death among persons. later years surplus cover added expenditures bank pay cases death receives premiums. example, attached table ii shows bank insures num r year old persons sum , , collects premium first years pay cases death. th year on, expenses deaths overtake premium income. example, th year, excess death claims premiums , . refore compelling consequence level premium method, life insurance bank set reserve fund. case, amount reserve fund arbitrarily set suits bank, ma matically precisely determined, just annual premium calculated ma matically precisely basis mortality table certain rate interest. example, insurance bank lower reserve fund, speculating mortality among insured advantageous expected mortality table used calculation premium will, consequence fortunate speculations, obtain higher interest income ir monies thus easily able cover shortage reserve funds. reserve fund set paid premiums existing insurance policies calculable interest deduction calculable future expenses death, sure calculable expenses, actually caused ones wise sustained excess mortality among insureds could, exhaust reserve fund, least significantly lower low level required future performance bank. reserve fund set premiums paid insured net premiums. premiums arrived exact calculation net premiums increased loading reimburse bank business expenses risk mortality among insureds exceeds expected limits. loading, size established individual banks according less arbitrary rules thumb, goes bank, reserve fund calculated remaining net premiums deduction loading. soon net premium descri d determined, reserve result ma matical consequence point time term insurance policy. rule net premium established remains constant whole term insurance policy, just loaded premium paid insured remains constant. clearly re reason include considerations relating amount net premium se rationally calculated, completely covering obligations bank. re insurance policies rising falling premium payments whereby naturally loaded premium changes different periods term insurance policy, net premium. arrive firmly established net premium lieve prefer general prefer especially current situation business, put forward several considerations participation german public life insurance increased gratifying fashion recent years. older german companies significant business earlier decades, newer german companies sides m

grow proportionately large scale addition new insurance policies. admit company required post actuarially sound reserve naturally required required set amount reserve basis determined, prescri d, traditional calculation model net level premium , n company reby run difficulties. expenses insurance policy, coverable mortality first year reserve set aside end first year according one calculation model circumstances greater premium income insurance policy. thus growing deficit naturally greater, greater increase new insurance policies is, increase sufficiently large, deficit come large even company significant means run difficulties. clear even lay person contradiction emerges here. one hand, one wishes ample increases new insurance policies hand, one financially embarrassed happen even demonstrated following commission rates en set high. wonderful solution found offered itself, really case. obvious thought old, usual method calculation close insurance policy posts costs growing closing, possibly prepaid commission account, account entered asset bank. sums brought account individual year n amortized certain num r years, preferable total amount prepaid commission year certain adequate portion premium income written off. model publicly discussed april year article german insurance paper breslau, various reasons sanction this. one, re measure limit amount costs placed prepaid commission account. essence account effect lessening base capital paid reserve n certainly possible endanger stability company excessive expenses acquisition new insurance policies. second, artificial asset prepaid commissions really gradually amortized. since requires relatively high fraction annual premium, means coverage costs gain long series years, respectively, unnecessarily lowered. finally, thirdly, re found, account prepaid commissions, sums prepaid insurance policies lapsed. later insureds n pay subsequently costs en incurred earlier insureds. following simple way one develops model completely untouched se disadvantages. one calculates net premium insurance policy way first year smaller certain amount following years. omit development necessary formula here. is,

reasons . stabilize underwriting results . provide protection catastrophic losses . increase underwriting capacity limits coverage insurer prudently assume based surplus nature business written .

professional reinsurers, whose exclusive business reinsurance reinsurance departments primary companies various organizations, reinsurance pools syndicates, lloyd s, government-owned companies. fourth, regulation reinsurance transactions limited. regulation occurs state insurance regulator granting credit reinsurance balance sheets primary ceding insurer. however, professional reinsurers
