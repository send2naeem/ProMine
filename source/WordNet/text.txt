 
Dictionary of Insurance Terms  
Insurance is a financial instrumentnothing more, nothing lessthat plays a critical role in both personal and business  
financial planning.  
On the personal level, the money an individual spends for insurance over a lifetime surpasses all other types of  
expenditures including the purchase of a home. Any doubt concerning this statement can be dispelled by adding up the  
premium payments made yearly for life insurance, health insurance, pension plan, social security, individual retirement  
account or Keogh Plan, automobile insurance, homeowners or tenants insurance, professional liability insurance, and  
umbrella liability insurance. Yet, the individual makes these expenditures usually without adequate knowledge of the  
insurance product purchased.  
Essentially the same situation exists in the business world. Contributions paid into various insurance coverages in most  
instances exceed other business operating expenses. Employee benefit plan contributions alone have been estimated to  
range between 30-45 cents for each dollar of salary paid to an employee. When added to the cost of other business  
related insurance expenditures such as workers compensation, buy-sell insurance funded agreements, key person  
insurance, business property coverage, business liability insurance, and other business specialty insurances coverages,  
the total cost can be overwhelming. And, astonishingly, the business insurance purchase decision is also frequently  
made without sufficient basic knowledge of the various insurance products available.  
Thus, one function of Barron's Dictionary of Insurance Terms is to serve as a reference source for individuals making  
personal and business insurance planning decisions. The Dictionary provides concise definitions and examples of those  
terms most likely to confront the insurance consumer on all levels. The insurance field is rapidly changing. More new  
insurance products have reached the marketplace in the last few years than in all previous years combined. The  
Dictionary contains definitions and illustrative examples of these "state of the art" offerings as well as of the traditional  
products. Cross references allow the reader to research variations of the terms to be defined and other relevant  
definitions.  
Another reason for the existence of Barron's Dictionary of Insurance Terms is to provide a reference source for  
practitioners who require succinct, technically accurate answers to insurance and risk management terminology  
questions. Professionals in the field will find the Dictionary to be a readily accessible reference source for virtually all  
terms that are used in the everyday conduct of business. The spectrum of insurance activities that is covered  
 
ranges from the home office underwriting of the risk to the actual marketing and distribution of the insurance product to  
protect the risk.  
The insurance agent may even find the Dictionary to be useful in marketing and servicing insurance products. Many  
clients have numerous questions concerning the characteristics of the various insurance products on the market, both  
new and traditional. The Dictionary can be used as a supplement to the sales literature to answer these questions as well  
as inquiries about servicing. Fast, accurate responses to these questions can sometimes mean the difference between  
closing and not closing a sale.

How to Use This Book Effectively  
Alphabetization: All entries are alphabetized by letter rather than by word, so that multiple-word terms are treated as  
single words. For example, AGE SETBACK follows AGENT OF RECORD, and ALL RISKS follows ALLOCATION  
OF ASSETS. In some cases (such as NAIC acts and regulations), abbreviations appear as entries in the main text, in  
addition to appearing in the back of the book in the separate listing of Abbreviations and Acronyms. This occurs when  
the short form, rather than the formal name, predominates in the common usage of the field. For example, NAIC is  
commonly used in speaking of the "National Association of Insurance Commissioners"; thus, the entry is at NAIC.  
Numbers in entry titles and the ampersand are alphabetized as if they were spelled out.  
Many words have distinctly different meanings, depending upon the context in which they are used. The various  
meanings of a term are listed by numerical or functional subheading. Readers must determine the context that is relevant  
to their purpose.  
Abbreviations and Acronyms: A separate list of abbreviations and acronyms follows the Dictionary.  
Cross-References: To add to your understanding of a term, related or contrasting terms are sometimes cross-referenced.  
The cross-referenced term will appear in SMALL CAPITALS either in the body of the entry (or subentry) or at the end.  
These terms will be printed in SMALL CAPITALS only the first time they appear in the text. Where an entry is fully  
defined by another term, a reference rather than a definition is providedfor example: PRODUCER see AGENT.  
Italics: Italic type is generally used to highlight the fact that a word or phrase has a special meaning to the trade. Italics  
are also used for the titles of publications.  
Parentheses: Parentheses are used in entry titles for two reasons. The first is to indicate that another term has a meaning  
identical or very closely related to that of the entry word; for example, BENEFITS OF BUSINESS LIFE AND  
HEALTH INSURANCE (KEY PERSON INSURANCE). The second reason is to indicate that an abbreviation is used  
with about the same frequency as the term itself; for example, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC).  
Special Definitions: Organizations and associations that play an active role in the field are included in the Dictionary  
along with a brief statement of their mission.

have a dependent son and daughter added to the policy as additional insureds. In many instances, adding an additional  
insured to an existing policy is less expensive than purchasing a separate policy for that insured.  
In property and liability insurance: another person, firm, or other entity enjoying the same protection as the named  
insured.

AGGREGATE LIMIT maximum dollar amount of coverage in force under a health insurance policy, a property damage  
policy, or a liability policy. This maximum can be on an occurrence basis, or for the life of the policy. The following are  
examples.  
1. Health insurance. The insured was billed $107,000 for a serious illness, but the aggregate limit of the policy was  
$100,000 for the life of the policy, so the most that the insured could be reimbursed is $100,000. The insured would  
have to pay $7000. Any medical expenses arising from future illness would now have to be paid by the insured.  
2. Liability insurance. The insured is at fault in an automobile accident (single occurrence) causing injury to four  
individuals of $100,000, $150,000, $85,000 and $115,000, respectively, a total of $450,000. The aggregate limit of the  
policy is $400,000. The insured would have to pay the remaining $50,000.  
AGGREGATE MORTALITY TABLE type of mortality table that is based on combined statistics from both the  
ULTIMATE MORTALITY TABLE and the AGGREGATE MORTALITY TABLE. It shows total statistics for the  
probability of living and dying throughout the entire life cycle.  
AGGREGATE PRODUCTS LIABILITY LIMIT maximum sum of money that the insurance company will pay, during  
the time interval that the PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage is in effect, for all product liability-related  
claims arising that are covered under the policy.  
AGGREGATE STOP LOSS INSURANCE coverage that goes into effect when an employer who has SELF  
INSURANCE has its total group health insurance claims attain a certain level, which is usually 125% of its annual  
projected group health claims costs.  
AGREED AMOUNT CLAUSE in PROPERTY INSURANCE, a stipulated agreement between the insurance company  
and the insured that the amount of insurance coverage under the policy is sufficient to be in compliance with the  
COINSURANCE requirement.  
AGREED AMOUNT FORM see AGREED AMOUNT CLAUSE.  
AGREEMENT see INSURING AGREEMENT.  
AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT INSURANCE property damage coverage for mobile agricultural equipment and  
machinery, including harness, saddles, blankets, and liveries. Perils insured are fire, lightning, vandalism, malicious  
mischief, and removal. Additional perils can be added at extra charge. Excluded from coverage are crops, aircraft,  
watercraft, feed, hay, and grass. (Crops, aircraft, and watercraft can be covered under other types of insurance policies.)

AIR CARGO INSURANCE coverage for an air carrier's legal liability for damage, destruction, or other loss of a  
customer's property while being shipped. Coverage is on an ALL RISKS basis subject to specific perils excluded in the  
policy. Air cargo insurance is a form of MARINE INSURANCE, which at one time only covered goods in transit over  
waterways. Today, goods in transit can be insured regardless of the means of transportation.  
AIRCRAFT HULL INSURANCE coverage on an ALL RISKS basis whether the airplane is on the ground or in the air;  
also called hull aircraft insurance. Exclusions, although none are standard, include illegal use of an aircraft; using an  
aircraft for purposes other than that described in the policy; wear and tear; piloting the aircraft by someone not named in  
the policy; operating an aircraft outside stipulated geographical boundaries; and damage or destruction of an aircraft  
resulting from war, riots, strikes, and civil commotions, mechanical breakdown loss, structural failure loss, and  
conversion. The hull value includes instruments, radios, autopilots, wings, engines, and other equipment attached to or  
carried on the plane as described in the policy.  
AIRCRAFT LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for the insured in the event that the insured's negligent acts and/or  
omissions result in losses in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of aircraft. Liability coverage can be  
provided for bodily injury and/or property damage to passengers and also to individuals who are not passengers.  
MEDICAL PAYMENTS INSURANCE may be included on an optional basis. See also AVIATION INSURANCE.  
AIRPORT LIABILITY COVERAGE insurance for owners and operators of private, municipal, or commercial airports,  
as well as fixed-base operators, against claims resulting from injuries to members of the general public or physical  
damage to the property of members of the general public, provided that these individuals are on the premises of the  
airport or its related facilities. The policy may include any or all of the following coverage's: (1) PREMISES AND  
OPERATIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE; (2) PERSONAL INJURY; (3) PREMISES MEDICAL PAYMENTS  
INSURANCE; and (4) contractual. The policy can be tailored to meet the particular requirements of the INSURED.

ALCM see ASSOCIATE IN LOSS CONTROL MANAGEMENT (ALCM).  
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL LAWS see DRAM SHOP LAW.  
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE LIABILITY INSURANCE see DRAM SHOP LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
ALEATORY CONTRACT contract that may or may not provide more in benefits than premiums paid. For example,  
with only one premium payment on a property policy an insured can receive hundreds of thousands of dollars should the  
protected entity be destroyed. On the other hand, an insurance company can collect more in premiums than it ever pays  
out in benefits, as in a fire insurance policy under which the protected property is either damaged or destroyed. Most  
insurance contracts are aleatory in nature.  
ALIEN INSURER insurance company formed according to the legal requirements of a foreign country. In order for an  
alien insurer to be able to carry on general operations and sell its products in a particular state in the United States, it  
must conform to that state's rules and regulations governing insurance companies.  
ALIMONY SUBSTITUTION TRUST agreement in which spouse X (the spouse who is mandated by the court to make  
alimony and/or child support payments to spouse Y) must put assets (the principal) in a TRUST, from which the  
payments are made to spouse Y. Under this trust, the payments made from the income generated by the principal is  
taxable income to spouse Y, but any sums paid from the corpus of the principal is not taxable income to spouse Y.  
Spouse X does not receive a tax deduction for payments made from the trust's corpus of principal, nor does spouse X  
pay income taxes on the income generated by the principal in the trust.

principally of property and casualty insurance companies. Its objectives are to influence the public and the legislators on  
matters concerning the property and casualty insurance industry, to publish materials, and to conduct research and  
various educational programs for member companies.

Standard Fire Policy. Allied lines include DATA PROCESSING INSURANCE, DEMOLITION INSURANCE,  
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE, INCREASED COST OF CONSTRUCTION CLAUSE, RADIOACTIVE  
CONTAMINATION INSURANCE, SPRINKLER LEAKAGE INSURANCE, STANDING TIMBER INSURANCE,  
VANDALISM AND MALICIOUS MISCHIEF INSURANCE, WATER DAMAGE INSURANCE.

Page 24  
ALL LINES INSURANCE combination of coverages from property, liability, health, and life insurance into a single  
insurance policy from one insurance company. See also MULTIPLE LINE INSURANCE.  
ALLOCATED BENEFITS payments in a DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. Benefits are allocated to the pension plan  
participants as premiums are received by the insurance company. Since the benefits purchased are paid up, the  
employee is guaranteed a pension at retirement, even if the firm goes out of business.  
ALLOCATED FUNDING INSTRUMENT insurance or annuity contract used in pension plans to purchase increments  
of retirement benefits through contributions for each employee paid into a fund. Benefits are guaranteed to employees at  
retirement; the insurance company is legally obligated to pay all benefits for which it has received premiums. Pension  
plans, in which no funds are available to purchase benefits prior to retirement involve UNALLOCATED FUNDING  
INSTRUMENTS (benefits were not purchased at the time premium payments were made).  
ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS see ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS ON TERMINATION.  
ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS ON TERMINATION distribution of assets if a pension plan is terminated. The  
allocation is made by either (1) refunding all of an employee's contributions, plus interest, or (2) establishment of  
classes of employees and their beneficiaries according to entitlement to benefits.  
ALLOWED ASSETS see ADMITTED ASSETS.  
ALL RISK INSURANCE see ALL RISKS.  
ALL RISKS insurance that covers each and every loss except for those specifically excluded. If the insurance company  
does not specifically exclude a particular loss, it is automatically covered. This is the broadest type of property policy  
that can be purchased. For example, if an insurance policy does not specifically exclude losses from wind damage, or  
from a meteor falling on the insured's house, the insured is covered for such losses. See also NAMED PERIL POLICY;  
SPECIFIED PERIL INSURANCE.  
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) many different, unofficial, and voluntary nonlitigation processes  
employed by insurance companies to resolve contractual disputes with their insureds. Examples would include  
nonbinding arbitration, simple negotiations between the insurance company and its insured, and mediation by a neutral  
third party. The objective of this type of dispute resolution is to avoid the substantial expenses that protracted litigation  
would generate.

ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM COST METHOD means of funding permitted under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT  
INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). The administrator of a pension plan can comply with required  
minimum funding standards by electing an alternative cost method under which the normal cost is the lesser of the  
normal cost (1) according to the actuarial cost method of the plan, or (2) according to the accrued benefit cost method  
without benefit projections.  
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX see CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX: IMPLICATIONS FOR  
CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE.  
ALTERNATIVE RISK FINANCING arrangement by which the insured agrees to incur a given degree of variability in  
the ultimate total costs associated with financing its losses.  
ALTERNATIVE RISK FINANCING FACILITIES provide mainstream coverage to their members that include  
corporations, public entities, and professionals. These facilities were originally established and capitalized by  
organizations and individuals with common requirements for insurance who could not obtain coverage on the  
commercial markets; could not obtain coverage at an acceptable price; could not effectively act as a CAPTIVE  
INSURANCE COMPANY; or could not act as a SELF-INSURER. Coverages written include property insurance,  
WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE,  
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LIABILITY INSURANCE, and primary and excess liability insurance. Insureds include a  
broad range of organizations and individuals: medical personnel, banks, manufacturers, public entities, nonprofit  
entities, contractors, and transportation companies and systems. The major portion of the facilities is domiciled in  
Bermuda.  
AMBIGUITY language in the insurance policy that can be considered unclear or subject to different interpretations.  
Under these circumstances, the courts have generally ruled in favor of insured individuals and against insurance  
companies since insurance policies are deemed to be contracts of adhesion, and also that insurance companies have  
sufficient legal talent at their disposal to make policy language clear.  
AMENDMENT provisions added to an original insurance policy that alter or modify benefits and coverages of the  
contract. For example, a HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY can be endorsed to cover a secondary dwelling;  
perils can be added for coverage. See also ENDORSEMENT; RIDER.  
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ACTUARIES professional association that sets standards of performance for those  
engaged in actuarial functions. Members are entitled to use the professional designation MAAA (Member, American  
Academy of Actuaries). The U.S. Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service requires that documents filed

calculations concerning benefits to be paid and their funding. The academy is located in Chicago, Illinois.  
AMERICAN AGENCY SYSTEM marketing of insurance through independent agents; also called independent agency  
system. Independent agents usually represent several insurance companies and try to insure the risk according to  
availability of coverage and most favorable price. Independent agents are paid a commission in the form of a percentage  
of the premiums generated by the policy sold. They own all the records of the policies sold and have the right to solicit  
renewals. They are not restricted to maintaining business with just one company and can transfer the business upon  
renewal to another company.  
AMERICAN ANNUITY TABLE, 1955 historical MORTALITY TABLE used to calculate PREMIUM rates for

AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) act that prevents employers from rejecting disabled job applicants  
on the grounds that hiring such an applicant would result in higher employee health care cost. Additionally, if the job  
applicant has a disabled spouse, child, or other dependent, regardless of whether or not the job applicant is also disabled,  
the employer cannot reject the job applicant on those grounds. Thus, the employer cannot exclude disabled employees  
and their dependents from its health plan on the ground that providing such coverage would increase the cost of health  
care. Title I of the act became effective for all employers with 25 or more employees on July 26, 1992.  
A disability is defined by the ADA as: ''A physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major  
life activities; or a record of such impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment." Title I mandates that:  
"All personnel actions must be unrelated to either the existence or consequence of disability to include recruitment and  
selection of employees; compensation of employees; training and all terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. If  
there are any conflicts with state laws, ADA takes precedence."

AMORTIZATION the systematic liquidation of a sum owed. A payment is charged at specific time intervals which will  
reduce the outstanding debt to zero at the end of a given period of time.  
AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE method of paying a sum due whose value has been discounted, according to a  
predetermined schedule. Each periodic payment includes part of the principal and interest due thereon.  
AMORTIZED VALUE see AMORTIZATION; AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE.  
AMOUNT AT RISK  
1. difference between the face value of a permanent life insurance policy and its accrued cash value. The pure cost of  
protection is based on this difference. For example, if the face value of a life insurance policy is $100,000 and the cash  
value is $80,000 then the net amount at risk is $20,000. From the Internal Revenue Service perspective, a corridor of  
protection or net amount of risk must be apparent in a life insurance policy if the policy is to retain its tax advantaged  
treatment.  
2. in property and liability insurance, the lesser of the policy limit or the maximum possible loss to the insured.  
AMOUNT FOR WHICH LOSS SETTLED see LOSS SETTLEMENT AMOUNT.  
AMOUNT OF INSURANCE TO VALUE proportion of the sum insured to the total property value. See also  
COINSURANCE.

ANIMAL LIFE INSURANCE see LIVESTOCK INSURANCE.  
ANNIVERSARY see POLICY ANNIVERSARY.  
ANNUAL AGGREGATE LIMIT pre-determined dollar amount up to which an insurance policy will cover an insured  
each year, regardless of the number of claims submitted or defense costs associated with these claims. For example, if  
the policy limit was established at $1,000,000, the insurance company would pay only up to $1,000,000 regardless of  
the number of claims during a particular year.  
ANNUAL CONVENTION BLANK see ANNUAL STATEMENT.  
ANNUAL EXPECTED DOLLAR LOSS over a long period of time, the AVERAGE loss an individual, individuals, or  
an organization can expect to incur from a particular EXPOSURE.  
ANNUAL INSURANCE POLICY see ANNUAL POLICY.

conditions have been met by the insured.  
ANNUAL REPORT statement of the financial condition of the insurance company, as well as significant events during  
the year in which the company has been involved and/or that have affected the company. This statement is furnished to  
the stockholders (if a STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY) or POLICYHOLDERS (if a MUTUAL INSURANCE  
COMPANY).  
ANNUAL STATEMENT report that an insurance company must file annually with the State Insurance Commissioner  
in each state in which it does business. The statement shows the current status of reserves, expenses, assets, total  
liabilities, investment portfolio, and employees earning over $40,000 per year. It provides information needed to assure  
that an insurance company has adequate reserves, and that assets are available to meet all benefit payments for which  
the company has received premiums. The form used is agreed upon by the National Association of Insurance  
Commissioners (NAIC). This form is also known as Annual Convention Blank.  
ANNUALIZED accounting method of establishing data on an annual basis.

Page 30  
ANNUITY contract sold by insurance companies that pays a monthly (or quarterly, semiannual, or annual) income  
benefit for the life of a person (the annuitant), for the lives of two or more persons, or for a spec-ified period of time.  
The annuitant can never outlive the income from the annuity. While the basic purpose of life insurance is to provide an  
income for a beneficiary at the death of the insured, the annuity is intended to provide an income for life for the  
annuitant. There are variations in both the way that payments are made by a buyer during the accumulation period, and  
in the way payments are made to the annuitant during the liquidation period.  
An annuity may be bought by means of installments, with benefits scheduled to begin at a specified age such as 65; or,  
it may be bought by means of a single lump sum, with benefits scheduled to begin immediately or at a later date. No  
physical examination is required. For variations in methods of payment, see CASH REFUND ANNUITY; FIXED  
DOLLAR ANNUITY; INSTALLMENT REFUND ANNUITY; JOINT-LIFE AND SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY;  
JOINT LIFE ANNUITY; LIFE ANNUITY CERTAIN; PURE ANNUITY; VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY.  
ANNUITY ANALYSIS includes rate of return, how long the annuity's interest rate is guaranteed, loads (front, middle  
and back), financial ranking of the insurance company offering the annuity, the monthly income factor per $1000 of  
cash value on deposit. For example, for the last item, if the monthly income factor is $6.18 per $1000 of cash value on  
deposit and the size of the cash value on account is $100,000, a male annuitant would receive a monthly income benefit  
of $618 at age 65.  
ANNUITY, CASH REFUND see CASH REFUND ANNUITY.  
ANNUITY, CD product that guarantees the initial interest rate for funds on deposit for the length of the maturity,  
whether it is for a period of 1, 3, 5, 10, or 15 years. At maturity, the POLICYHOLDER has two choices: (1) withdraw  
the funds without having to pay a SURRENDER CHARGE (it is important to note that taxes must be paid on the  
interest earned and there is a 10% penalty on the earnings if the policyholder is less than age 59 1/2); or (2) roll the  
funds over into another annuity for a limited number of years or a product of longer duration. In contrast to certificates  
of deposit (CDs), interest earned through this ANNUITY accumulates on a tax-deferred basis. This type of annuity  
provides liquidity, preserves principal, and stipulates a fixed rate of return.

ANTIFREEZE provision of the 1987 Tax Act that excludes life insurance owned by a third party or an irrevocable trust  
from FEDERAL ESTATE TAXES. Life insurance, as well as the deceased's personal residence, was exempted because  
neither is considered to be an "enterprise" as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS defines an  
enterprise as "any arrangement, relationship, or activity that has significant business or investment aspects."

COMMISSION as an inducement for an applicant to purchase insurance from him.  
ANTISELECTION see ADVERSE SELECTION.  
APP see APPLICATION.  
APPARENT AGENCY (AUTHORITY) situation wherein the agent's conduct causes a client or prospective insured  
reasonably to believe that the agent has the authority to sell an insurance policy and contract on behalf of the insurance  
company. For example, if an agent continues to use insurance company documents, such as its application forms, rate  
manuals, stationery, and emblems on the door, the client has every reason to believe that the agent does in fact continue  
to represent the insurance company.  
APPARENT AUTHORITY see APPARENT AGENCY (AUTHORITY).  
APPARENT AUTHORITY (PERCEIVED AUTHORITY) specific powers that a prospective insured believes the  
insurance company has granted to its AGENT. For example, if the insurance company has furnished the agent a rate  
book, application forms, stationery with the company logo, and sales literature, the prospective insured has reason to  
believe that an agency relationship exists between the insurance company and the agent. According to the doctrine of  
ESTOPPEL, the insurance company is prohibited from denying the relationship.  
APPEAL BOND guarantee of payment of the original judgment of a court. When a judgment is appealed, a bond is  
usually required to guarantee that if the appeal is unsuccessful, funds would be available to pay the original judgment as  
well as costs of the appeal. This serves to discourage an individual from appealing merely to stall for time or for  
frivolous reasons.  
APPLETON RULE regulation named after a former Superintendent of Insurance of New York State, and instituted in  
the early 1900s. It requires every insurer admitted to New York to comply with the New York Insurance Code and even  
in other states where that insurer does business. This rule has had a nationwide impact on the insurance industry. New  
York State is known for its leadership role in insurance regulation. Thus, if an insurance company is admitted to  
conduct business in New York, it is a sign that it has met exacting requirements.  
APPLICANT prospective insured who completes and signs a written form containing personal statements about himself/  
herself. See also APPLICATION.  
APPLICATION written statements on a form by a prospective insured about himself, including assets and other  
personal information. These statements and additional information, such as a medical report, are used by an insurance  
company to decide whether or not to insure the  
< previous page page_32 next page >  
 
< previous page page_33 next page >  
Page 33  
risk. Falsification or nondisclosure of information may give the insurance company grounds for rescinding a policy that  
has been issued. Statements in the application are also used to decide on an applicant's underwriting classification and  
premium rates.  
APPOINTED ACTUARY ACTUARY, appointed by the life insurance company, required by the NATIONAL  
ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) under the NAIC: STANDARD VALUATION LAW  
to provide an opinion as to the compliance of the insurance company's statutory statement with the law and the level of  
assets needed to support the statement of liabilities of the insurance company. In essence, this actuary is responsible for  
documenting the adequacy of the liability reserves according to the RESERVE LIABILITIES REGULATION as  
established by the NAIC.  
APPOINTMENT act by a company that authorizes an AGENT to act on its behalf.  
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES FOR TERMINATED PLAN plan initiated by the PENSION BENEFIT  
GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC) upon the involuntary termination of a pension plan. With the concurrence of  
the United States District Court, the PBGC appoints a trustee(s) to administer the terminated plan. The trustee(s)  
safeguards the remaining assets of the pension plan, protects the assets from being further depicted, limits further  
increases in liabilities, and in general acts as protector of the benefits for the pension plan's participants.  
APPOINTMENT PAPERS documents completed by the AGENT to effect authorization to act on behalf of the  
company.  
APPORTIONMENT division of a loss among insurance policies in the proportion that each policy bears to the total  
coverage applicable to the loss. For example, assume Policies A, B, C, and D have $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 and  
$80,000 of insurance in force, respectively: a total of $260,000 of coverage. Under the apportionment clause found in  
many property insurance policies, Policy A's percentage of any loss is 19.23%, Policy B's is 21.43%, Policy C's is  
26.92%, and Policy D's is 30.77%.  
APPORTIONMENT CLAUSE clause in a PROPERTY INSURANCE policy that requires the insurance coverage in  
that policy to be allocated in the proportion that it bears to the total insurance coverage in force from all policies  
covering that particular property. See also APPORTIONMENT.  
APPRAISAL valuation of property for damage resulting from an insured peril or for establishing the base amount of  
insurance coverage to be purchased. If an insured and an insurance company cannot agree on the amount of an insurer's  
liability for a property loss, the policy may specify that, upon written request, the dispute is submitted to appraisal.  
Usually, each party selects an appraiser and the two appraisers select a disinterested umpire. Disagreements by the  
appraisers go to the umpire, whose decisions typically are binding.

APPRAISAL CLAUSE clause in a PROPERTY INSURANCE policy that stipulates that either the insurer or the  
insured has the right to demand an APPRAISAL in order to determine the monetary damage or loss to an insured  
property.  
APPROVAL acceptance of an application for an insurance policy by the insurance company, indicated by the signature  
of an officer of the company on the policy. The officer, who must have signature authority, is usually the president or  
the secretary of the company. The agent who sells the policy normally does not have signature authority to approve the  
policy.  
APPROVAL CONDITIONAL PREMIUM RECEIPT insurance policy in force only after the insurance company  
approves the APPLICATION. Today, most companies use the INSURABILITY CONDITIONAL PREMIUM  
RECEIPT.  
APPROVED ROOF roof used in construction that is composed of fire resistive materials such as slate as approved by  
the UNDERWRITERS LABORATORIES INC. (UL).  
APPURTENANT STRUCTURES coverage for additional buildings on the same property as the principal insured  
building. Most property insurance contracts such as the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY cover appurtenant  
structures. For example, under the homeowners policy a separate garage on an insured's premise would be covered up to  
10% of the home's structure amount.  
ARBITRATION see ARBITRATION CLAUSE.  
ARBITRATION CLAUSE provision in a property insurance policy to the effect that in the event the insured and insurer  
cannot agree on the amount of a claim settlement, each appoints an appraiser. The appraisers select a disinterested  
umpire. When at least two of the three, appraisers and umpire, agree on the settlement amount, it is binding on both the  
insured and the insurer.  
ARIA see AMERICAN RISK AND INSURANCE ASSOCIATION.  
ARM see ASSOCIATE IN RISK MANAGEMENT (ARM).  
ARMORED CAR AND MESSENGER INSURANCE coverage during the transfer of securities and monies, precious  
metals, and other specified types of valuables by armored guard services. Policies are specifically designed to fit an  
insured's requirements. Standard coverage is available on an ALL RISKS basis, excluding perils of war, nuclear  
disaster, and dishonest acts of shipper and/or consignee.  
ARMSTRONG INVESTIGATION inquiry conducted by a committee of the legislature of the State of New York in  
1905 that looked at abuses of life insurance companies operating in the state. This study led to stricter supervision by  
New York and other state insurance departments. For example, many of the policies sold at that time contained  
< previous page page_34 next page >  
 
< previous page page_35 next page >  
Page 35  
language that made the receipt of benefits very difficult to obtain. As a result of the investigation, standard provisions  
were introduced into life insurance policies. While actual language is not dictated word for word by state regulatory  
authorities, a policy must provide minimum benefits (such as nonforfeiture provisions) expressed in acceptable  
language.  
ARP see ASSOCIATE IN RESEARCH AND PLANNING (ARP).  
ARREARS insurance policy under which premiums are past due but the GRACE PERIOD has not expired.  
ARSON actual or attempted malicious and deliberate burning of a physical asset owned by another party. Coverage  
against arson is provided under property insurance, but only if the insured has not committed the arson. The property  
insurance business has long worked to dis-courage arson and to prosecute arsonists.  
ASO see ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ONLY.  
ASSAILING THIEVES individuals other than the crew of a ship who forcefully steal the ship and/or its cargo. This  
event is an INSURED PERIL under OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE.  
ASSAULT threatening act, physical and/or verbal, which causes a person to reasonably fear for life or safety. For  
example, if a boxing champion said he was going to hit someone, this would probably cause a reasonably prudent  
person to fear serious bodily injury. An insured's liability for assault is excluded from all standard liability policies such  
as the SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP) and the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY.  
ASSESSABLE INSURANCE coverage in which an initial premium is charged, with the stipulation that an additional  
premium can be charged later if the loss experience of the insurance company warrants it; that is, if losses exceed  
premium income. See also ASSESSMENT COMPANY.  
ASSESSABLE MUTUAL assessment mutual company that operates on a statewide basis or in more than one state.  
Assessable or assessment mutuals operate by taking a cash deposit, or premium, from members in exchange for  
insurance protection. If the company's losses and expenses exceed these deposits, the company can assess members for  
additional monies to cover losses. These companies are commonly used by a group of local farmers or merchants in a  
small geographical area. Some states have specific laws governing these mutuals. For example, they might be limited to  
a certain type of business or have a maximum dollar limit for each risk.  
ASSESSED VALUE monetary worth of real or personal property as a basis for its taxation. This value, established by a  
government agency, is rarely used as a means to determine indemnification of an insured  
< previous page page_35 next page >

Page 36  
for property damage or destruction. See also INDEMNITY; REPLACEMENT COST LESS PHYSICAL  
DEPRECIATION AND OBSOLESCENCE.  
ASSESSMENT COMPANY insurance company that has the authority to assess or charge its policyholders for losses  
that the company is incurring. This company is sometimes called stipulated premium company or assessment  
association. These companies were relatively common in the 1800s and early 1900s but have since become rare. Most  
insurance companies cannot assess policyholders for losses. See also ASSESSMENT INSURANCE; ASSESSMENT  
PERIOD.  
ASSESSMENT INSURANCE contract under which an assessment insurance company can charge policyowners  
additional sums if the company's loss experience is worse than had been loaded for in the premium. This insurance is  
sometimes called stipulated premium and natural premium insurance. See also ASSESSMENT COMPANY;  
ASSESSMENT PERIOD.  
ASSESSMENT PERIOD time during which an assessment life insurance company has the right to assess policyholders  
if losses are worse than anticipated in the premium charged. See also ASSESSMENT COMPANY; ASSESSMENT  
INSURANCE.  
ASSESSMENT PLAN see ASSESSMENT COMPANY; ASSESSMENT INSURANCE; ASSESSMENT PERIOD.  
ASSET entity with exchange or commercial value, such as the book value of property owned by an insurance company  
as listed on its balance sheet.  
ASSET ADEQUACY TESTED RESERVE required RESERVE to satisfy all life insurance policy obligations and  
expenses according to the APPOINTED ACTUARY's best estimate assumptions. Numerous interest rate scenarios are  
tested and based on the projections. The amount of asset adequacy tested reserve is established.  
ASSET ALLOCATION long-term investment plan strategy under which all of the investor's investable assets are  
divided into predetermined proportions among several different types of securities. In theory, since these investments  
are placed into different classifications, each classification is subject to a different market cycle; therefore, the value of  
all investments should not incur a steep decline at the same time. Thus, such a portfolio approach should always have  
winners. Some specialized VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITIES offer such an approach.  
ASSET DEPRECIATION RISK one of four types of risks affecting the life insurance company as identified by the  
SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES. This risk is associated with losses that the life insurance company may incur as the result  
of default on the payment of interest (dividends) or principal on bonds, mortgages, general real estate investments, and  
stocks, as well as the loss in value of these investments resulting from a loss in their MARKET VALUE. See also  
GENERAL BUSINESS RISK; INTEREST RATE CHANGE RISK; PRICING INADEQUACY RISK.

ASSET QUALITY RISK see ASSET DEPRECIATION RISK.  
ASSETS AND VALUATION actuarial evaluation of the assets of a pension plan according to the fair market value of  
the assets.  
ASSET SHARE VALUE policyholder's equity share of the life insurance company's assets. The share is based on the  
policyholder's contribution to assets (the company's gross premiums minus cost of insurance, expenses and dividends  
for the classification to which the policy belongs). This computation is derived from the actual experience of the  
insurance company instead of the assumptions initially used in calculating premiums and reserves. The actual  
experience may or may not deviate significantly from the expected experience.  
ASSET SUFFICIENCY OR INSUFFICIENCY computation of the ASSET SHARE VALUE, surrender value, and  
reserve and the comparison of the three computations in order to judge the adequacy and equity of the tentative GROSS  
PREMIUM scale to be utilized.  
ASSET TRANSFER direct payment to a new custodian for a retirement plan. This payment is not a taxable event since  
it is not a distribution. The payment must be between like plans; for example, one INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT  
ACCOUNT (IRA) to another Individual Retirement Account.  
ASSET VALUATION excess or deficit of gross premium above the pure cost of insurance and expenses. The result  
becomes the valuation of the asset share of the policyholder at the end of a given year. The valuation of the asset share  
reflects the policyowner's share of the asset of the insurance company.  
ASSET VALUATION RESERVE (AVR) explicit liability RESERVE, required by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION  
OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC), established for all invested asset classes. Specific reserves are  
established for real estate and mortgages. In essence, the purpose of this reserve is to provide a back-up sum for  
potential equity and credit losses. To accomplish this objective, reserves are maintained for stocks, bonds, real estate,  
mortgages, and similar types of invested assets. Realized and unrealized equity and credit capital gains and losses are  
credited to or debited against this reserve. Amount of reserves required to be maintained for each invested asset is  
determined by ACTUARIAL formula.

ASSIGNMENT transfer of rights under an insurance policy to another person or business. For example, to secure a  
debt, it is not uncommon for the policyowner to transfer to the creditor his rights to borrow on  
< previous page page_37 next page >

the cash value. Life insurance policies are freely assignable to secure loans and notes (property and casualty insurance  
policies are not). Creditors such as banks often have printed assignment forms on hand at the time of making loans.  
ASSIGNMENT CLAUSE, LIFE INSURANCE feature in a life insurance policy allowing a policyowner to freely  
assign (give, sell) a policy to another or institution. For example, in order to secure a loan, a bank asks to be assigned  
the policy. If the insured dies before repayment of the loan, the bank would receive a portion of the death benefit that  
equals the outstanding loan, the remainder of the death benefit being payable to the insured's beneficiary. The fact that  
life insurance is freely assignable makes it a useful financial instrument through which to secure a loan. The insurance  
company does not guarantee the validity of the assignment.  
ASSIGNOR person who transfers rights under an insurance or mortgage contract.  
ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY items, equipment, or systems used to increase, improve, or maintain the capabilities of  
people with disabilities. These devices range from simple, such as penholders or cup holders, to complex, such as  
computer voice communication or robots. This technology is playing an increasing role in WORKERS  
COMPENSATION BENEFITS in returning insured workers to their jobs.

ASSOCIATION see POOL; SYNDICATE.  
ASSOCIATION CAPTIVE insurance company established by a trade group or other association to provide selected  
types of PRIMARY INSURANCE and/or LIABILITY INSURANCE for members of the association and access to  
REINSURANCE markets. For example, the American Newspaper Publishers Association has established an association  
captive to provide LIBEL INSURANCE for member newspapers, and the American Bankers Association sponsors a  
captive that provides DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE for member banks.  
ASSOCIATION GROUP bona fide organization that purchases insurance on a group basis on behalf of members.  
However, a group cannot be formed for the purpose of purchasing insurance since adverse selection would take place.  
Group selling permits economies of scale to operate, so that the cost of insurance to a member is appreciably less than  
an individual policy. The insurance company/agent is able to benefit through individual sales to the group's members.

ASSUMPTION CERTIFICATE see CUT-THROUGH ENDORSEMENT (ASSUMPTION OF RISK).  
ASSUMPTION OF RISK technique of risk management (better known as retention or SELF INSURANCE) under  
which an individual or business firm assumes expected losses that are not catastrophic losses through the purchase of  
insurance. For example, a business firm assumes the risk of its employees being absent because of minor illness, but  
buys disability insurance to cover absences due to extended illness. Also refers to (1) situations where insureds place  
themselves in situations that they realize pose a danger, and (2) the acceptance of risks by an insurance company.  
ASSUMPTION OF RISK RULE see ASSUMPTION OF RISK.  
ASSUMPTION REINSURANCE form of insurance whereby the buyer (REINSURER) assumes the entire obligation of  
the CEDENT company, effected through the transfer of the policies from the cedent to the books of the reinsurer.  
Several thousand policies are transferred annually among insurance companies. Generally, life, health, and investment  
type policies such as annuities are the policies most likely to be transferred since they are of longer duration and in  
many instances cannot be canceled by the insurance company.  
ASSUMPTIONS circumstances taken for granted. For example, in calculating annuity values, a particular interest rate  
is assumed. This assumption is critical to CURRENT ASSUMPTION WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE policies since  
projections of future cash values ultimately being realized are determined by the validity of the underlying assumptions.

ASYMMETRIC RISK EXPOSURE gain when the underlying asset that moves in one direction is significantly different  
from the loss when the underlying asset moves in the opposite direction; for example, when gains and losses associated  
with purchasing a call option on a stock are significantly different. Under a call option, when a stock price goes down,  
the loss incurred is limited to the purchase price of the option. If the stock price goes up, the purchaser of the call gains  
in proportion to the rise in the stock's value.

ATTACHMENT addition to a basic insurance policy to further explain coverages, add or exclude perils and locations  
covered, and add or delete positions covered. For example, an endorsement to the Standard Fire Policy might add  
coverage for vandalism and malicious mischief. This form has largely been replaced by an ENDORSEMENT or RIDER.  
ATTACHMENT POINT critical point in the total amount of claims paid above which the EXCESS INSURANCE  
policy pays a percentage (generally 80-100%) of the claims for any POLICY YEAR EXPERIENCE.  
ATTAINED AGE insured's age at a particular point in time. For example, many TERM LIFE INSURANCE policies  
allow an insured to convert to permanent insurance without a physical examination at the insured's then attained age.  
Upon conversion, the premium usually rises substantially to reflect the insured's age and diminished life expectancy.  
Since later in life rates become prohibitive, many insureds do not make an attained age conversion. See also  
ORIGINAL AGE.  
ATTAINED AGE CONVERSION see ATTAINED AGE.

AU see ASSOCIATE IN UNDERWRITING.  
AUDIT in WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE policies and several business property and liability policies,  
review of the payroll of a business firm in order to determine the premium for coverage. Premiums in workers  
compensation are based on units of payroll.  
AUDITORS REPORT see STATEMENT OF OPINION (ACCOUNTANTS REPORT, AUDITORS REPORT).  
AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE PLAN means of ending a pension plan only for reasons of business necessity,  
following IRS regulations. If the IRS determines that the plan was terminated for other reasons, employee and employer  
contributions become taxable. Reasons acceptable to the IRS include bankruptcy, insolvency, and the inability of a  
business to continue to make its contributions because of adverse financial conditions.  
AUTHORIZATION maximum amount of insurance coverage that an underwriter will write on a particular class of  
property or risk exposure.  
AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL RISK-BASED CAPITAL insurance company's theoretical capital amount and

POLICYOWNER to increase the monthly income sum at an approximate rate of 6%.  
AUTOMATIC INCREASE IN INSURANCE ENDORSEMENT see INFLATION ENDORSEMENT.  
AUTOMATIC NONPROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE automatic protection for an INSURER against losses that  
exceed a predetermined loss limit. This reinsurance may be subdivided into three primary types: EXCESS OF LOSS,  
CATASTROPHE LOSS, and stop loss. See also REIN-SURANCE.  
AUTOMATIC PREMIUM LOAN PROVISION life insurance policy clause. If at the end of the GRACE PERIOD the  
premium due has not been paid, a policy loan will automatically be made from the policy's cash value to pay the  
premium. The primary purpose is to prevent unintentional lapse of the policy. Funds in the cash value must at least be  
equal to the loan amount plus one year's interest. Many experts recommend this provision because under some  
circumstances the premium may go unpaid because of illness, vacations, or inadvertence.  
AUTOMATIC PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE form of coverage in which an insurer automatically reinsures  
individual risks with its reinsurer. The insurer must transfer (cede) the risks to its reinsurer and its reinsurer must accept  
this transfer (cession). Losses and premiums are shared; the reinsurer shares them in the same proportion as it does that  
total policy limits of the risks. The insurer receives from the rein-surer a transfer commission reflecting the so-called  
equity in the unearned premium reserve of the insurer. This provides for acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and the  
insurer's cost of servicing the business. Automatic proportional reinsurance may be subdivided into two primary types:  
quota share and surplus. See also REINSURANCE.  
AUTOMATIC REINSTATEMENT CLAUSE provision in a property or liability policy stating that after a loss has been  
paid, the total original limits of the policy are once again in effect. For example, assume a loss of $40,000 has been paid  
under a $100,000 property damage coverage HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY. After payment of the loss, the  
original $100,000 is reinstated.  
AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE automatic reinsuring of individual risks by an insurer with a reinsurer. The insurer  
must transfer the risks to its reinsurer and its reinsurer must accept this transfer. See also REINSURANCE.

AUTOMOBILE ASSIGNED RISK INSURANCE PLAN coverage in which individuals who cannot obtain  
conventional automobile liability insurance, usually because of adverse driving records, are placed in a residual  
insurance market. Insurance companies are assigned to write insurance for them, at higher prices, in proportion to the  
premiums written in a particular state. These plans protect motorists who suffer injury or property damage through the  
negligence of bad drivers who otherwise would not have insurance.  
AUTOMOBILE, BOAT, AND AIRCRAFT INSURANCE coverage for motorized vehicles, each of which requires  
separate policies for property damage and liability exposures. Motorized vehicles are not covered under a  
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY for property damage and/or bodily injury liability situations when operated  
away from an insured's premises.

caused by an automobile. The PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) and the BUSINESS AUTOMOBILE  
POLICY (BAP) cover the judgment awarded (up to the limits of the policy) and the court cost and legal defense fees.  
Experts advise against driving an automobile without automobile liability insurance as a matter of common sense, and  
because state laws require such a policy or evidence of financial responsibility. Passengers in automobiles should assure  
themselves that drivers are covered by this insurance.  
AUTOMOBILE PHYSICAL DAMAGE INSURANCE coverage in the event an insured's automobile is damaged,  
destroyed, or lost through fire, theft, vandalism, malicious mischief, collision, or windstorm. There are two kinds of  
property damage coveragecollision insurance and COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE. See also BUSINESS

AVERAGE arithmetic mean; the sum of a series of numbers divided by the number of numbers comprising the sum.  
For example, given the following series of numbers: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10, the arithmetic mean, or average,  
The arithmetic mean is the EXPECTED LOSS that the insurance company prepares itself to pay, as reflected in the  
BASIC PREMIUM.

AVERAGE, GENERAL see GENERAL AVERAGE.  
AVERAGE INDEXED MONTHLY EARNINGS (AIME) method of calculating the PRIMARY INSURANCE  
AMOUNT (PIA) for Social Security benefits. Employees' covered monthly earnings are adjusted to reflect changes in  
the national average annual earnings. Benefits should rise in proportion to increases in national average annual earnings.  
AVERAGE LOSS CLAUSE see PRO RATA DISTRIBUTION CLAUSE.  
AVERAGE MONTHLY EARNINGS (AME) see AVERAGE MONTHLY WAGE (AMW).  
AVERAGE MONTHLY WAGE (AMW) figure used in calculating a worker's PRIMARY INSURANCE AMOUNT  
(PIA) to determine Social Security benefits in the following manner:  
1. calculate the number of years between the worker's twenty-first birthday and the year prior to the worker reaching age  
62 (a maximum of 40 years).  
2. exclude the five lowest years of earnings, thereby selecting the 35 highest years (420 months) of earnings.  
3. divide the total of the 35 highest years of earnings by 420 months to calculate the Average Monthly Wage.  
A Social Security Administration table shows the PIA for the Average Monthly Wage calculated in Step 3. The PIA is  
then increased to reflect the COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT (COLA) to determine the actual benefit.

AVIATION ACCIDENT INSURANCE life insurance policy (individual or employee group basis) providing protection  
for a passenger on a regularly scheduled airline. See also AVIATION TRIP LIFE INSURANCE.  
AVIATION EXCLUSION common exclusion in life and ACCIDENTAL DEATH INSURANCE (double indemnity)  
policies, indicating that coverage does not apply unless an insured is a passenger on a regularly scheduled airline. For  
example, if an insured is killed while a passenger in a private plane crash, the aviation exclusion would apply, and the  
insured's beneficiary would not receive a death payment.  
AVIATION HAZARD additional HAZARD associated with aeronautics other than that of being a passenger on a  
regularly scheduled airline. An extra premium is charged, and/or there are usually exclusions applied to certain benefits  
associated with this hazard. For example, pilots of small private planes are subject to this hazard.  
AVIATION INSURANCE combination of PROPERTY INSURANCE on the hull of an airplane and LIABILITY  
INSURANCE in the following manner.  
1. property coverageprovided on an ALL RISKS basis or on a specified perils basis for the hull, autopilots, instruments,  
radios, and any other equipment in the airplane as described in the policy.  
2. liability coverageprovided in the event that the insured's negligent acts and/or omissions result in bodily injury and/or  
property damage to passengers and individuals who are not passengers.  
AVIATION TRIP LIFE INSURANCE term life insurance, usually purchased at an airport by an airplane passenger. It  
provides a death payment to the passenger's beneficiary in the event of a fatal accident on one or more specified flights.  
The term of coverage is from the time that the passenger enters the airplane until the time that he leaves. Ground  
transportation to and from the airport may also be covered. With the advent of hijacking and terrorism, this coverage is  
becoming more widely purchased.  
AVOIDANCE technique of risk management. It ensures that an individual or business does not incur any liability  
relating to a given activity by avoiding the activity in question. For example, a business that does not own computer  
equipment cannot incur financial loss due to the destruction of the computer by fire. However, in the real world, the risk  
control technique of avoidance is rarely practical. A more realistic approach is self-insurance or commercial insurance.

monthly income payment for company expenses.  
BACKUP WITHHOLDING RATE effective January 4, 1994, the backup withholding rate on dividends, interest, and  
gross proceeds distributions increased from 20% to 31%. Backup withholding applies in the following situations: (1) if  
a United States citizen or resident, United States corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or other entity fails to certify  
their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and  
Certification), or fails to provide documentation of their exemption from these rules; (2) if a taxpayer receives  
notification from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a missing or invalid TIN and fails to certify the TIN by  
providing the payor with the required documentation; (3) if the taxpayer is notified by the IRS that the taxpayer is not  
subject to backup withholding because of underreporting of interest or dividends on the tax return and is not notified  
that it no longer applies.  
BAGGAGE INSURANCE see TOURIST BAGGAGE INSURANCE.  
BAIL BOND monetary guarantee that an individual released from jail will be present in court at the appointed time. If  
the individual is not present in court at that time, the monetary value of the bond is forfeited to the court (jumping bail).  
Personal automobile policies commonly cover fees for an insured's bail bond.  
BAILEE individual who has temporary rightful possession of another's property. The bailee often furnishes a receipt in  
exchange for the bailor's property. For example, a dry cleaner has temporary custody of a suit to be cleaned and must  
exercise proper care to safeguard it against physical loss. If the property is damaged, the bailee's insurance policy often  
becomes the primary coverage and must indemnify the loss.  
BAILEE'S CUSTOMERS INSURANCE coverage for legal liability resulting from damage or destruction of the bailor's  
property while under the bailee's temporary care, custody, and control. Includes property on or in transit to and from the  
bailee's premises. Perils covered include fire, lightning, theft, burglary, robbery, windstorm, explosion, collision, flood,  
sprinkler leakage, earthquake, strike, and damage or destruction in the course of transportation by a common carrier.  
The insurance is in effect when the bailee issues a receipt to the bailor for the item. Coverage excludes property  
belonging to the insured bailee and loss due to vermin and insects. For example, a suit to be cleaned  
< previous page page_48 next page >  
 
< previous page page_49 next page >  
Page 49  
is under the temporary control of the bailee (cleaner). The bailor (owner) expects the suit to be returned in good  
condition. If the suit is stolen from the cleaner, the insurance would cover the loss.  
BAILMENT transfer of property from a bailor to a bailee; for example, transferring a suit to be cleaned from the bailor  
(owner) to the bailee (cleaners). See also BAILEE; BAILOR.  
BAILOR individual who retains title to property that is being transferred on a temporary basis to the care, custody, and/  
or control of another. See also BAILEE.

the statement are the company's assets and liabilities, and capital and surplus.  
BALANCE SHEET RESERVES amount expressed as a liability on the insurance company's balance sheet for benefits  
owed to policyowners. These reserves must be maintained according to strict actuarial formulas as they serve to  
guarantee that all benefit payments for which the insurance company has received premiums will be made.  
BAND SYSTEM system of classifying FACE AMOUNT of policies according to size within a given range. The  
premium rate per $1,000 of face amount varies on a declining basis. As the face amount increases, the premium rate per  
$1,000 of face amount decreases.  
BANK BURGLARY AND ROBBERY INSURANCE coverage on the bank's premises for burglary of monies,  
securities, and other properties from within the bank's safe(s); robbery of monies and securities; loss of monies and  
securities as the result of vandalism or malicious mischief; general damage due to vandalism and malicious mischief  
resulting from burglary and/or robbery.  
BANKERS BLANKET BOND coverage for a bank in the event of loss due to dishonest acts of its employees or

BARGAIN SALE charitable planning strategy in which a donor sells an asset to the charity for an amount less than its  
fair market value. Internal Revenue Service regulations require that the tax basis for the property be established on a pro  
rata schedule between the sale portion and the gift portion. The donor has a taxable gain on the sale portion.  
BARRATRY violation of duty in marine insurance, such as acts of the master and crew of a ship that result in damage  
to the vessel including purposefully running it aground, diverting it from its true course of travel, stealing of its cargo,  
and abandoning the vessel.  
BASELINE DATA statistics (such as health data from physical examination of employees or other insureds) used as a  
benchmark from which deviations and comparisons of expected losses, as well as future actual losses, are measured.  
BASE PREMIUM a CEDING COMPANY'S premium to which the reinsurance premium factor is used to produce the  
reinsurance premium.  
BASIC BENEFITS, BASIC HOSPITAL PLAN minimum payments provided under a health insurance policy. See also  
GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE; HEALTH INSURANCE.  
BASIC LIMIT minimum amount of coverage for which a company will write a LIABILITY INSURANCE policy.  
BASIC LIMITS OF LIABILITY required minimum amounts of coverage that an insurance company will underwrite.  
For example, for auto liability coverage the minimum that many companies will write is $25,000. Most liability suits are  
not below this range.  
BASIC MORTALITY TABLE MORTALITY TABLE that is a picture of the actual living and/or dying of the  
population (the universe) upon which the mortality table is based. No additions or subtractions are made to these  
statistics to show a greater or lesser probability of living or dying than is actually expected to occur.  
BASIC PREMIUM premium applied in WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE and in life insurance. In the  
latter, it is the portion of a premium that is loaded to reflect an insured's expectation of loss, administrative expenses  
associated with putting the policy on the company's books, and the agent's commission.  
BASIC RATE see MANUAL RATE.  
BASIC TIME FRAME time period, for a life insurance policy, in which losses occur. This period must be determined

BENCHMARKING management tool through which a plan for evaluation, measurement, and improvement is  
implemented. The insurance entity can use this tool to analyze market trends, measure sales performance, measure  
market penetration, and measure product performance.  
BENCHMARK SURPLUS additional amount of SURPLUS from an additional amount of CAPITAL necessary to act  
as a supplement to the cash flow in the event unforeseen contingencies occur that disrupt or impair the cash flow  
necessary for the insurance company to make future benefit payments for which it has received the premiums.  
BENEFICIARY designation by the owner of a life insurance policy indicating to whom the proceeds are to be paid  
upon the insured's death or when an endowment matures. Anyone can be named a beneficiary (relative, non-relative,  
pet, charity, corporation, trustee, part-nership). A primary beneficiary is the first-named beneficiary, who must survive  
the death of the insured in order to collect the proceeds. A contingent or secondary beneficiary will receive the proceeds  
if the primary beneficiary does not survive the insured. A revocable beneficiary (primary or secondary) can be changed  
by the policyowner at any time. An irrevocable beneficiary (primary or secondary) can be changed by the policyowner  
only with the written permission of that beneficiary. Naming an irrevocable beneficiary removes the policy from the  
estate of the insured, who thereby gives up incidences of ownership for estate tax purposes.  
If a beneficiary is convicted of murdering the insured, the beneficiary cannot collect the death benefit. The insured's  
estate would receive the benefit.  
BENEFICIARY CLAUSE provision in a life insurance policy that permits the policyowner to name anyone as primary  
and secondary beneficiaries. The policyowner may change the beneficiaries at any time by simply writing the insurance  
company and sending the policy for endorsement if that is requested. See also BENEFICIARY.  
BENEFICIARY OF TRUST person for whom the trust was created and who receives the benefits thereof. In many  
instances a trust is established to prevent the careless exhaustion of an estate. For example, the  
< previous page page_51 next page >

Page 52  
establishment of a trust for the benefit of a child seeks to guarantee that the parent's estate will not be carelessly  
diminished.  
BENEFIT monetary sum paid or payable to a recipient for which the insurance company has received the premiums.  
BENEFIT ALLOCATION METHOD method of funding a PENSION PLAN under which a single premium payment is  
made to fund a single unit of benefit for one year of recognized service with the employer. For example, if the employee  
earned an $85 unit of benefit for year X of recognized service to begin at age 60, a SINGLE PREMIUM DEFERRED  
ANNUITY would be purchased for that employee's account. Each year this procedure would be repeated as additional  
single premium deferred annuities would be purchased for each year of recognized service. At the time of retirement,  
the annuities so purchased would be combined to provide a monthly income benefit for the employee.  
BENEFIT FORMULA procedure in employee benefit plans to calculate life insurance and retirement benefits to which  
an employee is entitled. See also DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN; DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION (MONEY  
PURCHASE PLAN); GROUP LIFE INSURANCE.  
BENEFIT PERIOD in HEALTH INSURANCE, the number of days for which benefits are paid to the NAMED  
INSURED and his or her dependents. For example, the number of days that benefits are calculated for a calendar year  
consist of the days beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year.  
BENEFITS OF BUSINESS LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE (KEY PERSON INSURANCE) life insurance and  
long-term disability income insurance on major employees, with benefits payable to the business. Key person insurance  
has these advantages: (1) enhances the ability of the business to continue operations; (2) fosters smooth sale of a going  
business between an estate and a purchaser by providing funds to buy out the interest of a deceased key person; (3)  
encourages key employees to stay on the job; (4) attracts new key employees; (5) provides funds for expenses of hiring  
and training of a replacement key employee; (6) provides a line of credit (A permanent life insurance policy has cash  
values that are available for loans at advantageous rates.); (7) policy proceeds, which are income free, are payable even  
if the key person is no longer in the employ of the business at the time of death; however, the business must continue to  
make the premium payments after the key person leaves the employment; (8) a life insurance policy can be surrendered  
for its cash value or sold to the insured key person; thus, the business will usually at least receive the return of  
premiums; (9) long-term disability income insurance on a key person also provides funds for salary continuation to the  
disabled key person. (For temporary disability, the business might prefer to self insure because the expense of premiums  
for this coverage is  
< previous page page_52 next page >

BID BOND bond required of a contractor submitting the lowest bid on a project. If the contractor then refuses to  
undertake the project, the bid bond assures that the developer will be paid the difference between the lowest bid and  
next lowest bid. The bid bond encourages contractors to make serious bids and live up to their obligations.  
BILATERAL CONTRACT contract under which there is an exchange of a promise for a promise. An INSURANCE  
POLICY is deemed to be a UNILATERAL CONTRACT.  
BILL OF LADING document used in the transportation of goods that must be presented when a claim is made for a loss  
incurred. This document establishes the fact that the goods were under the care, custody, or control of the shipper at the  
time the loss occurred.  
BINDER temporary insurance contract providing coverage until a permanent policy is issued. In property and casualty  
insurance, some agents have authority to bind the insurance company to cover until a policy can be issued. For example,  
the purchaser of an automobile can call the agent, who can then bind the insurance company to temporary coverage.  
BINDING AUTHORITY see BINDER.  
BINDING RECEIPT evidence of a temporary contract obliging a property insurance company to provide coverage as  
long as the premium accompanies the application. A property insurance agent can bind a company to cover a specific  
risk. Some agents are authorized to give an oral binder, which is generally followed with a written binder. For life and  
health insurance, see also CONDITIONAL RECEIPT.  
BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION statistical function that displays the probability of determining a stated number of  
successes in a series of trials in which the probability of success is the same in each trial. In insurance, the binomial  
distribution is used to analyze certain future events. Some chance events have only two possible outcomes; the  
probability of occurrence p = 1 q and the probability of nonoccurrence q = 1 p. (Note that p + q = 1; that is to say, the  
probability of success plus the probability of failure is always equal to 1.) The probability of  
< previous page page_53 next page >  
 
< previous page page_54 next page >  
Page 54  
exactly x outcomes (x successes) in n independent repetitions is given by the function  
where x = 0,1,2, . . . ,n  
For example, if a fair coin is tossed in the air a total of six times, the probability of getting exactly five heads is:  
BIRTH RATE number of people born as a percentage of the total population in any given period of time.  
BLACK LIST STATES states that preclude the placement of SURPLUS LINES with particular insurance companies.  
BLACKOUT PERIOD time interval between the date benefits end under Social Security and the date these benefits  
resume. For example, survivor benefits are paid only as long as the parent (if less than age 60) cares for a child less than  
age 16. Once that child reaches age 16, the surviving parent must wait until age 60 before survivor benefits resume.  
BLANKET BOND coverage for an employer in the event of dishonesty of any employee. See also FIDELITY BOND.  
BLANKET CONTRACT policy covering an insured's property at several different locations. This coverage is used by  
business firms that have several locations and may move property from location to location.  
BLANKET COVERAGE see BLANKET BOND; BLANKET CONTRACT; BLANKET CRIME POLICY;  
BLANKET INSURANCE; BLANKET MEDICAL EXPENSE INSURANCE; BLANKET POSITION BOND.  
BLANKET CRIME ENDORSEMENT see BLANKET CRIME POLICY.  
BLANKET CRIME POLICY coverage usually provided as part of the SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP)  
policy, generally replaced by the COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY, through the attachment of the Blanket Crime  
Endorsement. Perils covered include dishonesty of a business's employees; loss of money both while inside as well as  
outside a business's premises; lost money orders; forgery due to the acts of a depositor; and counterfeit paper currency.  
Since this crime policy is so comprehensive it is said to provide the insured with a blanket of coverage. This policy has  
largely been replaced by the COMMERCIAL CRIME COVERAGE FORM.

BLANKET INSURANCE single policy on the insured's property for (1) two or more different kinds of property in the  
same location; (2) same kind of property in two or more locations; (3) two or more different kinds of property in two or  
more different locations. Blanket coverage is ideal for such businesses as chain stores, all of whose property is covered  
with no specific limit on each particular property regardless of its location (thereby enabling the business to shift  
merchandise from store to store). This insurance can (but need not) be written on an ALL RISKS basis subject to  
exclusions of war, nuclear dis-aster, and wear and tear.  
BLANKET LIMIT maximum amount of insurance coverage that an insurance company will underwrite in a particular  
geographic area.  
BLANKET MEDICAL EXPENSE INSURANCE health insurance policy providing coverage for an insured's medical  
expenses except those that are specifically excluded. This may be the most advantageous medical expense policy for an  
insured because unless a specific medical expense is excluded it is automatically covered.  
BLANKET POSITION BOND covers all employees of a business on a blanket basis with the maximum limit of  
coverage applied separately to each employee guilty of a crime. See also COMMERCIAL BLANKET BOND,  
FIDELITY BOND.  
BLANKET RATE premium charged (and applied on a uniform basis) for property insurance covering properties at  
multiple locations. This rate is used under a BLANKET INSURANCE policy instead of using a specific rate for each  
location or type of property.  
BLENDED/INTEGRATED INSURANCE PROGRAM insurance programs that combine FINITE RISK INSURANCE,  
REINSURANCE, and traditional insurance as an alternative to SELF INSURANCE. These programs are long-term in  
duration. The objective is to incorporate the advantages of a finite risk insurance program (management of cash flow,  
smoothing of income and profit sharing) with the advantages of transferring the risk through traditional insurance.  
BLOCK LIMITS total amount of insurance that an insurer will write on any specific city block. Such a limit will reduce  
the insurer's exposure to a potential catastrophic occurrence, such as a hurricane, tornado, or fire, which could destroy  
the entire block.  
BLOCK OF POLICIES total number of INSURANCE POLICIES under-written and issued by the INSURANCE  
COMPANY that uses the same policy forms and rates.

or more ships, when all ships are at fault, all owners and shippers having monetary interests in the voyage of the ships  
involved must share in all losses in proportion to the monetary values of their interests prior to the occurrence of the  
collision. This clause supercedes all other provisions for the allocation of losses among owners and shippers in ocean  
marine policies.

Greece held to the concept  
< previous page page_58 next page >  
 
< previous page page_59 next page >  
Page 59  
that a loan on a ship was canceled if the ship failed to return to its port. This concept was adopted by Lloyd's of London  
in the 1600s when insuring England's merchants for goods shipped to the colonies. The formation of property and  
casualty insurance companies worldwide began by insuring the transport of merchandise over bodies of water.

BREACH OF CONTRACT failure of a party (not having a legal excuse) to perform in accordance with a promise  
made. An INSURANCE POLICY consists of legally enforceable promises made by the INSURANCE COMPANY  
(INSURER) only. No such promises are made by the INSURED. This is the reason why the insurance policy is a  
UNILATERAL CONTRACT.

bridge.  
BRIDGE INSURANCE FOR BRIDGES UNDER CONSTRUCTION provides coverage during the construction of a  
bridge in the event of fire, lightning, collision, flood, rising water, windstorm, ice, explosion, and earthquake. This  
coverage is essential, since the value of destroyed labor and materials could bankrupt a contractor without insurance  
protection.  
BROAD EVIDENCE RULE rule that stipulates how to calculate the ACTUAL CASH VALUE of property that has  
been damaged, destroyed, or stolen. The thesis of this rule is that whatever evidence that can be produced of the true  
value of the property is admissible; the factual insurable value of the property can be ascertained by whatever measures  
provide the most accurate picture of that property's real value. Thus, this is a method of determining the true insurable  
worth of a structure according to any measure that will provide the most accurate analysis of that property's value. This  
method is becoming more widely accepted as a means of measuring actual cash value.

BUSINESSOWNERS POLICY (BOP) combination property, liability, and business interruption policy. It is usually  
written to cover expenses of small and medium size businesses resulting from (1) damage or destruction of business's  
property or (2) when actions or nonactions of the business's representatives result in bodily injury or property damage to  
another individual(s). Businesses that qualify under this heading include office buildings three stories or under not to  
exceed 100,000 square feet; apartment buildings six stories or under not to exceed 60 dwelling units; any other  
buildings not to exceed 7500 square feet for mercantile space, occupied principally as an apartment, office, or engaging  
in trade or commerce. Properties that cannot be insured under this policy include banks, condominiums, bars,  
restaurants, automobiles,

POLICYSECTION I: PROPERTY COVERAGES; BUSINESSOWNERS POLICYSECTION II: LIABILITY  
COVERAGES.  
BUSINESSOWNERS POLICYSECTION I: PROPERTY COVERAGES contract that details coverage for business  
property losses in three specific areas:  
1. Coverage A (Building). All buildings on the site are covered with no coinsurance requirement and on a replacement  
cost basis to include: the buildings themselves; the owner's personal property used to maintain the building(s) and  
provided to tenants; permanent fixtures, equipment and machinery; improvements and betterments by tenants; removal  
of debris; and outdoor furniture and fixtures.  
2. Coverage B (Personal Property of the Business). All personal property used in the business on the premises, as well  
as personal property of others under the care, custody and control of the owner of the building used to operate the  
business; and limited coverage for items temporarily away from the premises of the business as well as for property  
purchased and placed at a new business location.  
3. Coverage C (Loss of Income). Reimbursement for loss of income because of inability to collect business rent;  
interruption of normal business functions; and extra expenses associated with resuming normal business activities as the  
result of the damage or destruction of business property by an insured peril. (Optionally, under Section I, coverage can  
be extended to insure against burglary, robbery, theft, employee dishonesty, and boiler and machinery explosion.  
Earthquake damage can be covered through an endorsement.)  
BUSINESSOWNERS POLICYSECTION II: LIABILITY COVERAGES coverage that protects a business, up to the  
policy limits, if actions or non-actions of the insured result in a legally enforceable claim for bodily injury, property  
damage, or personal injury. Included are coverages for: (1) nonowned automobiles used by the business in its normal  
operations (owned automobiles are excluded); (2) host liquor liability where the business is having a social gathering.  
For example, liability at an office party would be covered, since this social function is incidental to normal business  
activity (excluded would be operation of a liquor store on the premises of the business); (3) fire and explosion legal  
liability, where the insured is renting business space in a building. If a fire or explosion from business operations is  
proven to be of negligent origin, the insurer of the owner of the building has subrogation rights against the business; (4)  
products, for which completed operations coverage is provided. Excluded from Section II coverages are professional  
liability, owned automobiles of the business, operation of airplanes and other aircraft, Workers Compensation, liquor  
liability (other than that served as a host at business social functions), and off-premises operation of boats.

BUSINESS PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE PACKAGE protection of the property of the business that is  
damaged or destroyed by perils such as fire, smoke, and vandalism; and/or if the actions (or nonactions) of the business'  
representatives result in bodily injury or property damage to other individuals. Many insurance policies provide such  
coverages, but the two most often used are the COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY and the BUSINESSOWNERS  
POLICY (BOP).  
BUSINESS RISK investment risk associated with the changes in the earnings capability of the company. If the earnings  
capability declines, the company's ability to maintain the current dividend level and to increase future dividends is  
diminished.  
BUSINESS RISK EXCLUSION omissions from coverage found in products liability insurance. The policy does not  
provide coverage if the business manufactures a product that does not meet the level of performance as advertised,  
represented, or warranted. For example, an automobile antifreeze is advertised as being able to withstand temperatures  
as low as 30� below zero. An engine block containing the fluid freezes at a temperature of 10� above zero. In this  
instance a products liability policy would not provide coverage for the insured business.  
BUSINESS STARTS INDEX statistical compilation that reports the number of new incorporated and nonincorporated  
businesses started during a single week. This index is published by Dun & Bradstreet.  
BUSINESS TRANSACTED WITH PRODUCER CONTROLLED PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURER ACT model  
act written and published by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) whose  
purpose it is to regulate BROKERS who control INSURANCE COMPANIES. The act permits the insurance  
commissioners to institute civil actions in the event they perceive broker violations (broker's conduct contributing to the  
insolvency of a controlled insurance company and the respective state insurance commissioner requires the broker to  
make restitution to that state's guarantee fund).  
BUY-AND-SELL AGREEMENT approach used for sole proprietor-ships, partnerships, and close corporations in  
which the business interests of a deceased or disabled proprietor, partner, or shareholder are sold according to a  
predetermined formula to the remaining member(s) of the business. For example, a partnership has three principals.  
Upon the death of one, the two survivors have agreed to purchase, and the deceased partner's estate has agreed to sell,  
the interest of that partner according to a predetermined formula for valuing the partnership to the survivors. Funds for  
buying out the deceased partner's interest are usually provided by life insurance policies, with each partner purchasing a  
policy on the other partners. Each is the owner and beneficiary of the policies purchased on the other partners.  
When a sole proprietor dies, usually a key employee is the buyer/successor. The sole proprietorship, partnership, and  
close cor-  
< previous page page_70 next page >

Page 71  
poration under the entity plan can buy and own life insurance policies on the proprietor, partner, or shareholder and  
achieve the same result as when an individual buys and owns the policies.  
BUY-BACK DEDUCTIBLE DEDUCTIBLE eliminated through the payment of an additional premium, resulting in  
FIRST-DOLLAR COVERAGE under the policy.  
BYPASS TRUST type of TRUST used to remove assets from a surviving spouse's estate, thereby excluding such assets  
from FEDERAL ESTATE TAX upon the death of the surviving spouse. This type of trust allows for a lifetime benefit  
to be available to both spouses while living, as well as to a single surviving spouse. A bypass trust permits a maximum  
of $1.2 million transfer to heirs of the spouses on a tax-free basis under the unified gift and estate tax credits.

CAFETERIA BENEFIT PLAN arrangement under which employees may choose their own employee benefit structure.  
For example, one employee may wish to emphasize health care and thus would select a more comprehensive health  
insurance plan for the allocation of the premiums, while another employee may wish to emphasize retirement and thus  
allocate more of the premiums to the purchase of pension benefits.  
CAFETERIA PLANS see SECTION 125 PLANS (CAFETERIA PLANS).  
CALCULABLE CHANGE OF LOSS see PROBABILITY.  
CALENDAR YEAR ACCOUNTING INCURRED LOSSES losses paid plus positive or negative changes in the yearend  
loss reserves during that particular year. The total amount includes payments for any old claims as well as new  
claims, plus any reevaluation of claim amounts already on the books at the beginning of the year, as well as required  
reserves for the new claims.  
CALENDAR YEAR EXPERIENCE paid loss experience for the period of time from January 1 to December 31 of a  
specified year (not necessarily the current year).  
CALENDAR YEAR STATISTICS see CALENDAR YEAR EXPERIENCE.  
CALL OPTION contract that gives the insurance company the right, not the obligation, to buy a stipulated stock or  
bond at a specified price (strike price) at or before the date of expiration of the contract.  
CAMERA AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS DEALERS INSURANCE coverage on an ALL RISKS basis for the  
insured's own property as well as property of others under the insured firm's care, custody, and control. Exclusions are  
WEAR AND TEAR, MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE, earthquake, flood, theft from an unlocked and unattended  
vehicle, loss of market, and delay. For example, if a dealer's personal flute is damaged by fire, or if a customer's camera  
is stolen, the dealer would be covered for both occurrences up to the limits of the policy.  
CAMERA FLOATER camera and related equipment coverage found in INLAND MARINE INSURANCE.  
CANADIAN INSTITUTE OF ACTUARIES membership organization representing professional actuaries in all  
insurance fields in Canada including life and health, casualty, consulting and fraternal actuaries. A member must reside  
in Canada and belong to an approved actuarial organization, including the SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES (SA).  
CANCEL termination of a policy. Contract may be terminated by an insured or insurer as stated in the policy. If the  
insurance company  
< previous page page_72 next page >  
 
< previous page page_73 next page >  
Page 73  
cancels a policy, any unearned premiums must be returned. If an insured cancels the policy, an amount less than the  
unearned premiums is returned, reflecting the insurance company's administration costs of placing the policy on its  
books. Usually this term is applied only in property and disability insurance.

CANCELLATION PROVISION CLAUSE provision permitting an insured or an insurance company to cancel a  
property and casualty or a health insurance policy (circumstances vary; see also COMMERCIAL HEALTH  
INSURANCE) at any time before its expiration date. The insured must send written notice to the insurance company,  
which then refunds the excess of the premium paid above the customary short rates for the expired term. If the insurance  
company cancels, it sends written notice to the insured of cancellation and refunds the unearned portion of the premium.  
CANCELLATION, SHORT RATE see SHORT RATE CANCELLATION.  
CAP see COINSURANCE.  
CAPACITY maximum that an insurance company can underwrite. The limits of coverage that a property and casualty  
company can under-write are determined by its retained earnings and invested capital. REINSURANCE is a method of  
increasing the insurance company's capacity, in that a portion of the unearned premium reserve maintenance  
requirement can be relieved. Commissions earned are ceded, underwriting results are stabilized, and financing of the  
expansion of the insurer's capacity can take place.  
CAPACITY OF PARTIES legal capability of those involved in mutual assent of making a contract, including an  
insurance contract. Those who have been deemed to be incompetent to make a valid contract include intoxicated and  
insane persons, and enemy aliens. Minors can enter into a contract, but it is voidable at the option of the minor. For  
example, if an agent sells an insurance policy to a minor, and the insurance company agrees to underwrite it, the policy  
can be voided at any time the minor wishes both before and after the minor reaches the age of majority. The insurance  
company cannot void the contract.  
CAPITAL equity of shareholders of a stock insurance company. The company's capital and SURPLUS are measured by  
the difference between its assets minus its liabilities. This value protects the interests of the company's policyowners in  
the event it develops financial problems; the policyowners' benefits are thus protected by the insurance

company's capital. Shareholders' interest is second to that of policy-owners.  
CAPITAL GAINS excess of the sales price of an asset over its book value. Listed as part of the Annual Report in the  
summary of the surplus account and/or in the Summary of Operations.  
CAPITAL STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY company that has a capital fund established by contributions from its  
stockholders in addition to its SURPLUS ACCOUNTS and RESERVE ACCOUNTS.  
CAPITAL SURPLUS PAID-IN SURPLUS, revaluation surplus, and donated surplus. This surplus includes all sources  
of surplus with the exception of EARNED SURPLUS.  
CAPITATED CONTRACT health plan that pays a flat fee for each patient it covers.  
CAPITATION PAYMENTS payments made on a monthly basis by users of the medical services of HEALTH  
MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS (HMOs). After this payment is calculated for a future period of time, usually  
one year, the payment will remain fixed for that period, regardless of the frequency of use of the HMO's services.  
CAPTIVE AGENT representative of a single insurer or fleet of insurers who is obliged to submit business only to that  
company, or at the very minimum, give that company first refusal rights on a sale. In exchange, that insurer usually  
provides its captive agents with an allowance for office expenses as well as an extensive list of employee benefits such  
as pensions, life insurance, health insurance, and credit unions.  
CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATION (CICA) trade association located in New York City,  
consisting of approximately 200 CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES. The objective of the association is to further  
the common interests of its members.  
CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY company formed to insure the risks of its parent corporation. Reasons for  
forming a captive insurance company include:  
1. Instances when insurance cannot be purchased from commercial insurance companies for a business risk. In many  
instances companies within an industry form a joint captive insurance company for that reason.  
2. Premiums paid to a captive insurance company are deductible as a business expense for tax purposes according to the  
Internal Revenue Service. However, sums set aside in a self insurance program are not deductible as a business expense.  
3. Insurance can be obtained through the international reinsurance market at a more favorable premium, with higher  
limits of coverage.  
4. Investment returns can be obtained directly on its invested capital.

However, competent personnel to manage and staff the company could be excessively expensive; and further, a  
catastrophic occurrence or series of occurrences could bankrupt the company.  
CARE, CUSTODY, AND CONTROL phrase in most liability insurance policies that eliminates from coverage damage  
or destruction to property under the care, custody, and control of an insured. Such coverage is excluded from liability  
policies because the insured either has some ownership interest in such property (better covered through property not  
liability insurance) or is a bailor of the property (and can better cover this bailment exposure through an appropriate  
bailee policy).  
CARGO INSURANCE shipper's policies covering one cargo exposure or all cargo exposures by sea on ALL RISKS  
basis. Exclusions include war, nuclear disaster, wear and tear, dampness, mold, losses due to delay of shipment, and loss  
of market for the cargo. One Cargo Exposure (Single Risk Cargo Policy) covers a single shipment of goods and/or a  
single trip. All Cargo Exposure (Open Cargo Policy) covers all shipments of goods and/or all trips generally used by  
most shippers that require automatic coverage for all of its shipments, subject to 30 days' notice of cancellation.  
CARGO LIABILITY INSURANCE see CARGO INSURANCE.  
CARGO MARINE INSURANCE see CARGO INSURANCE.  
CARPENTER PLAN (SPREAD LOSS COVER, SPREAD LOSS REINSURANCE) form of excess of loss reinsurance  
under which each year's REINSURANCE premium is determined by the amount of the cedent's excess losses for a  
given period of time, usually three or five years. Upon renewal, the first year's initial rate is based on the total of three or  
five years of previous experience, a form of RETROSPECTIVE RATING. The Carpenter Plan is particularly relevant  
to economic conditions in the way it handles the factor of inflation.  
CARRIER insurance company that actually underwrites and issues the insurance policy. The term is used because the  
insurance company assumes or carries the risk for policyowners. The agent usually has a primary carrier (the insurance  
company to which most of the business is submitted) and secondary carriers (to which lesser amounts are submitted).  
The primary carrier provides the agent with commission schedules, expense allowance, and the availability of markets  
for the agent's business.

CASH ACCUMULATION METHOD procedure used to compare the costs of life insurance policies by having equal  
DEATH BENEFITS of the policies held constant and accumulating the differences in the premiums  
< previous page page_75 next page >  
 
< previous page page_76 next page >  
Page 76  
paid among the policies at a given interest rate over a stipulated period of time. At the end of that time period, that  
policy with the largest accumulated value in the difference of the premiums paid is the best cost effective policy.  
CASH-BALANCE PLAN hybrid PENSION PLAN that provides for the employer to contribute annually a hypothetical  
percentage, usually 4 to 5%, of the employee's salary to a hypothetical account. This employee's account is then credited  
with a hypothetical annual interest rate generally tied to the 30-year United States Treasury rate. If the employee should  
change employment, the account balance can be transferred to an INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA),  
subject to certain restrictions peculiar to each employer. For example, some employers restrict the withdrawal of a  
terminating employee to an amount no greater than the employee's one-year salary with the account's balance to be paid  
out as a monthly income benefit. When the employee retires at age 65 most of these plans have a five-year VESTING  
requirement.  
CASH FLOW PLANS method of payment of an insurance premium that allows an insured to regulate the amount and  
frequency of the premium payments in accordance with cash flow over a stipulated period of time. This enables the  
insured to maintain control over the funds for a longer period of time and thus reap benefits from their earnings.  
CASH FLOW SURPLUS the SURPLUS resulting from an additional amount of CAPITAL necessary to act as a  
supplement to the reserves in the event of unforeseen contingencies that would impair the insurance company's ability  
to make future benefit payments for which it has received the premiums.  
CASH FLOW UNDERWRITING pricing of the insurance product below the necessary premium rate to reflect the  
costs of expected losses. The thesis of this pricing strategy is to obtain large sums of money to invest and earning a  
greater return on the investment than the costs associated with the underpricing of the insurance product.  
CASH OUT OF VESTED BENEFITS money withdrawn by an employee from benefits owned. When an employee  
exercises this right, future benefits purchased by the employer on behalf of the employee are usually forfeited.  
CASH REFUND ANNUITY (LUMP SUM REFUND ANNUITY) if the annuitant dies before receiving total income at  
least equal to the premiums paid, the beneficiary receives the difference in a lump sum. If the annuitant lives after the  
income paid equals the premiums paid, the insurance company continues to make income payments to the annuitant for  
life. See also ANNUITY.  
CASH SURRENDER VALUE money the policyowner is entitled to receive from the insurance company upon  
surrendering a life insurance policy with cash value. The sum is the cash value stated in the  
< previous page page_76 next page >  
 
< previous page page_77 next page >  
Page 77  
policy minus a surrender charge and any outstanding loans and interest thereon.  
CASH VALUE see CASH SURRENDER VALUE.  
CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE policy that generates a savings element. Cash values are critical to a permanent life  
insurance policy. The size of a cash value buildup differs substantially from company to company. In many instances  
there is no correlation between the size of the cash value and premiums paid; in some cases there is an inverse  
relationship. Everything that the policyowner wishes to do with this policy while living is determined by the size of the  
cash value. For example, at some future time, a policyowner may wish to convert the cash value to a monthly retirement  
income. Its size will depend on (1) the amount of the cash value and (2) the attained age of the policy owner. See also  
ANNUITY; NONFORFEITURE BENEFIT (OPTION).  
CASH WITHDRAWALS removal of money from an individual life insurance policy or an employee benefit plan. A  
cash withdrawal from a life insurance policy reduces the death benefit by the amount of the withdrawal plus interest  
thereon. When a cash withdrawal is made from an employee benefit such as a pension plan, the employee usually  
forfeits all benefits purchased on the employee's behalf by the employer. See also CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE.  
CASUALTY liability or loss resulting from an ACCIDENT. Such liability or losses are covered under such policies as  
the following: BUSINESS AUTOMOBILE POLICY (BAP), BUSINESS PROPERTY AND LIABILITY  
INSURANCE PACKAGE, BUSINESSOWNERS POLICY (BOP), CASUALTY INSURANCE, COMMERCIAL  
GENERAL LIABILITY FORM (CGL), CONDOMINIUM INSURANCE, HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY,  
PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP), SIMPLIFIED COMMERCIAL LINES PORTFOLIO POLICY (SCLP),  
TENANTS INSURANCE, AND WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE.  
CASUALTY ACTUARIAL SOCIETY (CAS) accrediting body for the ACAS (Associate of the Casualty Actuarial  
Society) designation and the FCAS (Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society) designation. To earn these designations,  
members take a series of examinations on actuarial mathematics and related topics as they apply to the property and  
casualty insurance field. Passing the examinations denotes a sound background in mathematics as well as knowledge of  
business such as finance and economics. Located in New York City.  
CASUALTY CATASTROPHE casualty losses of high severity. See also CASUALTY INSURANCE.  
CASUALTY INSURANCE coverage primarily for the liability of an individual or organization that results from  
negligent acts and omissions, thereby causing bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. However, the term  
is an elastic one that traditionally has included such property insurance as AVIATION INSURANCE, BOILER AND

MACHINERY INSURANCE and glass and crime insurance. See also BUSINESS LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
CATASTROPHE EXCESS REINSURANCE see EXCESS OF LOSS REIN-SURANCE.  
CATASTROPHE FUTURES financial instrument traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). By purchasing this  
future, the insurance company can hedge its risk exposure against possible future catastrophic losses. The CBOT  
releases a report each quarter showing on a state-by-state basis the premium amount and the line of insurance that has a  
catastrophic exposure. Each future contract has a stated value of $25,000 multiplied by the catastrophe ratio for that  
particular quarter. This multiplied result forms the basis for beginning to trade the quarterly catastrophic futures contract  
on the CBOT. If there is a high level of catastrophes such that the actual catastrophic loss ratio is greater than the  
expected catastrophic loss ratio, the futures contract increases in value and the insurance company purchaser gains the  
difference between the initial purchase price and the quarterly ending value of the contract. Conversely, if there is a low  
level of catastrophes such that the actual catastrophic loss ratio is less than the expected catastrophic loss ratio, the  
futures contract decreases in value and the insurance company purchaser loses the difference between the initial  
purchase price and the quarterly ending value of the contract.  
CATASTROPHE HAZARD circumstance under which there is a significant deviation of the actual aggregate losses  
from the expected aggregate losses. For example, a hurricane is a hazard that is catastrophic in nature, since whole units  
or blocks of businesses may be threatened. Catastrophic hazards often cannot or will not be insured by commercial  
insurance companies either because the hazard is too great or because the actuarial premium is prohibitive. Where a  
void exists in the marketplace, a government agency may subsidize the coverage with such programs as FEDERAL  
FLOOD INSURANCE and SERVICE-MEN'S GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (SGLI).  
CATASTROPHE INSURANCE see COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE; GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE;

CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE FUTURES AND OPTIONS first exchange-traded RISK MANAGEMENT tool  
specifically developed for the insurance industry by the Chicago Board of Trade as a way for the primary insurance  
company to offset its underwriting exposures. See also FUTURES TIED TO REINSURANCE. These contracts are  
designed to provide the insurance company with a hedge against UNDERWRITING LOSSES resulting from  
catastrophic occurrences. The futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a  
set price on a given date. The option permits the owner to decide whether or not to exercise the option to buy or sell the  
commodity or financial instrument by the stipulated exercise date. The insurance option trading is based on the loss  
ratio concept (losses incurred over a stipulated time period divided by premiums earned over the same time period). For  
example, assume an insurance company buys an option on the loss ratio that will fall within the range of 50% to 70%.  
Should losses fall within that range, the insurance company would then exercise the option and sell the contract, thereby  
enabling the company to make a profit on the option. This profit could then be used by the company to offset losses.  
Should the loss portion not fall within the 50% to 70% range, the option would expire at zero value.  
CAT SPREAD type of DERIVATIVE traded on the Chicago Board of Trade that takes the form of an option on a  
catastrophe futures contract using a call-option spread as the basis for the contract. The thesis of this kind of derivative  
is to simulate an artificial layer of EXCESS OF LOSS REIN-SURANCE coverage. This derivative has the origin of its  
value in the excess of loss reinsurance plan to be used as a mechanism for the PRIMARY INSURER hedging its risk  
coverage. See also CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE FUTURES AND OPTION; FUTURES CONTRACTS.

nonemployed hospital physicians. The objective of this means of insurance coverage is to increase the number of  
patients being admitted to the hospital by tying staff physicians to that particular hospital through this insurance plan.  
This insurance strategy could lead to lower premiums resulting from loss control programs and joint legal liability  
defense programs. (The hospital and physician jointly defend against a patient's liability claim rather than each party  
retaining an attorney, which would increase expenses and develop an adversarial relationship between hospital and  
physician.) This program can be implemented through a joint hospital and physician program insuring both hospital and  
physician under the same insurance policy or the hospital can purchase a separate insurance policy for the physician.

CHARITABLE AND GOVERNMENT IMMUNITY principle that no liability exposure can result from the  
performance of proprietary functions.  
CHARITABLE GIFT ANNUITY donation of amount "A," made by donor X to a charity. The charity agrees to pay  
donor X an amount ("B") for the rest of donor X's life. Since the donation is used to fund an annuity, only a percentage  
of the donation can be taken as a tax-deductible gift in the year of the donation. The percentage taken is based on the  
Internal Revenue Service tables at the donor's age at the time of the donation. This gift is irrevocable. Since the donor is  
dependent on the charity to make the income payments, the donor should ascertain the financial ability of the charity to  
make those income payments. Thus, such an annuity permits the donor to transfer appreciated property to a charitable  
organization in exchange for the organization's promise to pay a continuous stream of income.  
CHARITABLE GIFT LIFE INSURANCE life insurance policy given by a donor to a charity; donor only relinquishes  
the CASH VALUE and the cost of the PREMIUMS previously paid. The receiving charity's future value of the life  
insurance policy is the DEATH BENEFIT. Since the charity is the owner of the policy, it can: (1) borrow against the  
cash value; (2) surrender the policy for its then cash value; or (3) utilize its CONVERSION PRIVILEGES. The donor  
can enjoy an income tax deduction for the value of the life insurance policy contributed to a qualified charity, provided  
the donor does not retain any ownership rights to that policy. If the donor makes an irrevocable transfer of the life  
insurance policy to a qualified charity and all rights of ownership have been forfeited to the charity, the death benefit  
will not be included in the donor's estate, provided the donor survives for at least three years after the date of transfer.  
CHARITABLE LEAD TRUST trust in which a charity receives income from a donated asset for a specified number of  
years that it is held in that trust. After the specified period concludes, the principal is transferred to the donor's  
beneficiaries. This vehicle is used to keep wealth in the family by significantly reducing the costs of transfer to  
beneficiaries. The charity has the use of the income earned by that money, but the charity does not have use of the  
principal. This distribution is a taxable gift.  
CHARITABLE REMAINDER ANNUITY TRUST special type of CHARITABLE REMAINDER TRUST (CRT)  
under which a designated beneficiary (cannot be a charitable beneficiary) receives an annual fixed income. The grantor  
of the trust is allowed an income tax deduction of the amount of the present value of the charity's remainder interest as  
of the date the asset(s) is contributed to the trust. If trust income proves to be inadequate to meet the required payments  
to the beneficiary, the selling-off of a portion of the trust's principal or capital gains earned by the trust may be used to  
make up the difference. Any excess amount  
< previous page page_82 next page >  
 
< previous page page_83 next page >  
Page 83  
of income generated by the trust above that required to pay the beneficiary is reinvested into the trust. Once this trust  
has been created, additional assets cannot be transferred into the trust.  
CHARITABLE REMAINDER TRUST (CRT) TRUST to which a donor transfers assets and that distributes income to  
finance a predetermined situation. After the trust expires, any remaining assets are donated to the qualified charity that  
was previously designated as the remainder beneficiary (BENEFICIARY OF TRUST). In the year of transfer, the donor  
receives a tax deduction for the future value of the assets that were transferred to the trust. Thus, under this type of trust,  
the donor (person who creates the trust) simply makes an irrevocable transfer of an asset(s) to a trustee. According to  
the trust agreement, the trustee must: (1) invest the asset contributed to the trust; (2) pay a predetermined annual income  
to the donor and/or another designated beneficiary for life or stipulated number of years; and (3) distribute the asset(s)  
to the charity, either when the donor dies or when a specific designated income beneficiary dies.  
CHARITABLE REMAINDER UNITRUST trust under which the beneficiary (cannot be a charitable beneficiary)  
receives a fixed percentage (not less than 5% of the trust's annual value) of the net fair market value of the trust on an  
annual basis. The annual income paid to the beneficiary must be either for life or for 20 or fewer years. The yearly  
payment will increase or decrease as the value of the trust assets increases or decreases. Additional contributions may be  
paid into the trust after it has been created.  
CHARITABLE REVERSE SPLIT DOLLAR (CRSD) financial technique for providing term death coverage for an  
entity. With this procedure: (1) an individual purchases an ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE POLICY and completes an  
agreement with the entity for a reverse SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE arrangement; (2) an individual endorses a  
policy's death benefit to the entity; (3) an entity assigns its interest in the policy to the charity; (4) an entity makes  
unrestricted gifts of cash to the charity in the form of premium payments according to the split dollar agreement; (5) an  
entity receives a charitable income tax deduction for gifts of cash (premium payments); (6) the POLICYOWNER  
(INSURED) is then entitled to make a tax-free withdrawal of all or a portion of the CASH VALUE, or take out a  
POLICY LOAN.  
CHARITABLE SPLIT DOLLAR INSURANCE PLAN arrangement that provides for the reduction of estate taxes and  
the payment of tax-deductible life insurance premiums. The procedure is for a donor to present a charity with a gift of a  
sum of money that is tax deductible to the donor. The charity then transfers this gift in the form of a premium payment  
on an ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE policy on the donor's life (the INSURED). The beneficiaries under the policy  
are the charity and the donor's heirs. Upon the death of the donor, the charity and the donor's heirs share in the DEATH  
BENEFIT from the policy. The donor's

heirs also receive the cash value accrued on a tax-deferred basis within the policy.

CLOSE end of a sales presentation designed to prompt the PROSPECT to purchase the insurance product.  
CLOSE CORPORATION PLAN prior arrangement for surviving stockholders to purchase shares of a deceased  
stockholder according to a predetermined formula for setting the value of the corporation. Often, the best source for its  
funding is a life insurance policy in either of these forms: (1) Individual Stock Purchase Plan (Cross Purchase Plan),  
much like the partnership cross purchase plan. Each stockholder buys, owns, and pays the premium for insurance equal  
to his/her share of the agreed purchase price for the stock of the other stockholders. (2) Corporation Stock Purchase  
Plan (Stock Redemption Plan), similar to the partnership entity plan is a better choice if the number of stockholders is  
large. The corporation purchases and pays the premiums on the amount of insurance needed to purchase the decreased  
stockholder's interest at the price set by the predetermined formula. These premiums are not tax deductible as a business  
expense, but the death benefits are not subject to income tax. Life insurance owned by the corporation is listed as an  
asset on the corporation's balance sheet. Ownership of life insurance on the stockholders thus increases the corporation's  
net worth, and if permanent insurance is purchased, its cash value would be available for loans in the event of business  
emergencies.

CODING placement of verbal descriptive information into numerical form for the purposes of analysis.  
COINSURANCE in PROPERTY INSURANCE, when the insurance policy contains this clause, coinsurance defines  
the amount of each loss that the company pays according to the following relationship:  
Where:  
Example:  
Value of building = $100,000  
Coinsurance Clause Percentage Amount of Insurance Required = 80%  
Amount of Fire Damage to the Building = $60,000  
Amount of Insurance Carried = $75,000  
The insurance company would be required to pay $56,250 of the $60,000 loss:  
Note that the indemnification of the insured for a property loss can never exceed (1) the dollar amount of the actual loss;  
(2) the dollar limits of the insurance policy; (3) the dollar amount determined by the coinsurance relationship. The lesser  
of the above three amounts will always apply.  
In commercial health insurance, when the insured and the insurer share in a specific ratio of the covered medical  
expenses, coinsurance is the insured's share of covered losses. For example, in some policies the insurer pays 75 80% of  
the covered medical expenses and the insured pays the remainder. In other policies, after the insured pays a deductible  
amount, the insurer pays 75 80% of the covered medical expenses above the deductible and the insured pays the  
remainder until a maximum dollar amount is reached (for example, $5000). The insurer pays 100% of covered medical  
expenses over this dollar amount up to the limits of the policy.  
COINSURANCE CLAUSE see COINSURANCE.  
COINSURANCE FORMULA see COINSURANCE.  
COINSURANCE LIMIT in a MERCANTILE OPEN-STOCK BURGLARY INSURANCE policy, the dollar amount of  
coverage as required by the  
< previous page page_89 next page >  
 
< previous page page_90 next page >  
Page 90  
COINSURANCE clause. This dollar amount is the MAXIMUM PROBABLE LOSS (MPL) of merchandise that the  
insurer estimates could result from a single burglary. The indemnification of the insured merchant cannot exceed the  
lesser of this coinsurance limit or the COINSURANCE PERCENTAGE of the total dollar value of the merchandise that  
has been insured.  
COINSURANCE PENALTY reduction in the amount that the insured receives from the insurer, after having incurred a  
property loss, because the insurer failed to carry the amount of coverage required by the COINSURANCE clause. See  
also COINSURANCE REQUIREMENT.  
COINSURANCE PERCENTAGE in many PROPERTY INSURANCE policies, a requirement that the insured carry  
insurance as a percentage of the total monetary value of the insured property. If this percentage is not carried, the  
insured is subject to the COINSURANCE PENALTY. See also COINSURANCE; COINSURANCE REQUIREMENT.  
COINSURANCE PLAN OF REINSURANCE type of PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE under which the CEDING  
COMPANY (PRIMARY INSURER) CEDES a portion of the FACE AMOUNT of the life insurance policy it has  
underwritten to its REINSURER. The reinsurer, in the event of the death of the insured, is obligated to pay its PRO  
RATA share (thus the alternate name PRO RATA REINSURANCE) of the DEATH BENEFIT to the ceding company  
that in turn must pay the full death benefit to the insured's BENEFICIARY. Under this plan, the reinsurer is also  
obligated to pay its pro rata share of all settlement options under the life insurance policy to include the CASH  
SURRENDER VALUE. The reinsurer receives from the ceding company a pro rata share of the GROSS PREMIUMS  
paid on the policy to the ceding company. In return, the ceding company receives a ceding commission (to cover its  
expenses incurred in marketing, underwriting, and distributing the life insurance policy) from the reinsurer.  
COINSURANCE REQUIREMENT amount of insurance that the insured must carry in order to be indemnified for the  
total dollar amount of the actual loss. If this requirement is met by the insured, the COINSURANCE PENALTY will  
not go into effect. The amount of insurance required is usually expressed as a percentage of the value of the property  
insured at the time the loss is incurred; however, the amount may also be expressed as a flat dollar amount. See also  
COINSURANCE; COIN-SURANCE PERCENTAGE.

COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT designation of a policy's death benefit or its cash surrender value to a creditor as  
security for a loan. If the loan is not repaid, the creditor receives the policy proceeds up to the balance of the outstanding  
loan, and the beneficiary receives the remainder. Because life insurance is freely assignable it is readily acceptable to  
lending institutions as security. Also, the lender is certain to receive the money should death strike the borrower before  
the loan can be repaid.  
COLLATERAL BOND BOND that provides additional security for a loan.  
COLLATERAL BORROWER individual who assigns rights to a benefit. For example, a life insurance policy may be  
assigned as security for a loan made by the borrower. The policy protects the COLLATERAL CREDITOR  
(ASSIGNEE) if the borrower does not pay the loan when due. If a loan remains unpaid at the death of an insured, the  
loan balance is subtracted from the death benefit and paid to the creditor, with the balance going to the insured's  
beneficiary. On the other hand, if the insured (the borrower) does not pay the loan when due, the creditor can withdraw  
the amount due from the cash value of the policy. When a loan is repaid, the assignment ends and the policyowner is  
again vested with all rights to the policy.  
COLLATERAL CREDITOR (ASSIGNEE) individual to whom rights to a benefit are assigned. A life insurance policy  
is assigned by the COLLATERAL BORROWER (assignor) to the collateral creditor (assignee) as security for a loan.  
See also COLLATERAL BORROWER.  
COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOs) bonds that are secured by mortgage securities classified  
as either interest only or principal only strips (separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities).  
Insurance companies find CMOs desirable because of their predictable cash flow patterns.  
COLLATERAL SOURCE RULE judicial rule of evidence under which no reduction in damages awarded by a court is  
allowed for bodily injury, sickness, illness, or accident merely because the plaintiff has other financial sources paying  
benefits such as HEALTH INSURANCE and DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE.  
COLLECTION BOOK record a debit (or other) agent makes for premiums collected, time period for which the policy is  
paid, and the week of collection or date the premium was paid. In essence, the debit agent, through the collection book,  
becomes a bookkeeper as well as a salesperson, since at the end of each week the agent has to balance the debit book,  
which in some instances is time consuming. See also DEBIT AGENT.

COMBINATION POLICY (PLAN)  
1. a contract in life insurance that includes elements of whole life and term insurance.  
2. in pensions, a combined life insurance policy and a side (auxiliary) fund to enhance the amount of a future pension.  
3. in automobile insurance, different coverages using policies of two or more insurance companies (rare).  
COMBINATION SAFE DEPOSITORY INSURANCE covers property damage and theft coverage in two areas not  
subject to a coinsurance requirement or a deductible.  
Coverage A. If the bank becomes liable for loss to a customer's property while that property is: (1) on the bank's  
premises in safe deposit boxes in the vault; or (2) being deposited into or taken out of the safe deposit boxes.  
Coverage B. Loss to the bank customer's property due to burglary or robbery, whether actual or attempted, even if the  
bank is not held liable.  
COMBINED RATIO in insurance, combination of the LOSS RATIO and the EXPENSE RATIO:  
The combined ratio is important to an insurance company since it indicates whether or not the company is earning a  
profit on the business it is writing, not taking into account investment returns on the premiums received. The property  
and casualty insurance business sometimes goes through cycles. During the 1980s, for instance, it was not unusual to  
have a combined ratio of over 120%. Obviously, the difference has to be made up from the company's surplus, which in  
some instances even put the major companies under severe financial strain.  
COMBINED SINGLE LIMIT bodily injury liability and property damage liability expressed as a single sum of  
coverage.  
COMMENCEMENT OF COVERAGE date at which insurance protection begins.  
COMMERCIAL BLANKET BOND coverage of the employer for all employees on a blanket basis, with the maximum  
limit of coverage applied to any one loss without regard for the number of employees involved. Both commercial and  
position blanket bonds work the same way if only one employee causes the loss, or if the guilty employee(s) cannot be  
identified. For example, five identifiable employees as a team steal $50,000. A $10,000 BLANKET POSITION BOND  
would cover the loss in full. A $50,000 commercial blanket bond would be required to repay the insured business for  
the same loss.

liability, the policy limits are said to be exhausted and no more claims for that year will be paid under the policy. There  
is also an aggregate limit of liability in force for products and completed operations liability claims. This form has  
replaced the COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE (CGL) form.

COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE coverage that provides two types of benefits, DISABILITY INCOME (DI)  
and medical expenses. Sold by insurance companies whose business objective is the profit motive (as distinct from Blue  
Cross/Blue Shield) it can be classified by its RENEWAL PROVISION, and types of benefits provided.  
1. Renewal Provisions: (a) Optionally renewable. The insurance company has the option to renew the policy at the end  
of the term period (one year, six months, three months, or one month). If the company renews the policy, it has the  
option to adjust the premium up or down; limit the types of perils insured against; and limit some or all of the benefits.  
(b) Nonrenewable for stated reasons only. When the insured reaches a certain age or when all similar policies are not  
renewed, the policy is said to be nonrenewable for the reasons stated. (c) Noncancellable. The insurance company must  
renew the policy and cannot change any of the provisions of the policy nor raise the premium while the policy is in  
force. (d) Guaranteed renewable. The company must renew the policy but the company has the option to adopt a new  
rate structure for the future renewal premiums.  
2. Benefits Provided: (a) Disability income for total and partial disability subject to a maximum dollar amount and  
maximum length of time. Limitations include: pre-existing injury or condition; elimination period beginning with the  
first day of disability during which no benefits are paid; probationary period during which no benefits are paid for a  
sickness contracted or beginning during the first 15, 20, 25, or 30 days that the policy is in force; a recurrent disability  
such that before the current disability will be deemed to be a new disability, the insured must have returned to full time  
continuous employment for at least six months. (b) medical expense benefits for hospital charges for room, board,  
nursing, use of the operating room, physicians and surgeons fees; and miscellaneous medical expenses for laboratory  
tests, drugs, medicines, X-rays, anesthetics, artificial limbs, therapeutics, and ambulance service to and from the  
hospital.

COMMERCIAL MULTIPLE PERIL POLICY see COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY (CPP)  
COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY (CPP) insurance policy that is COMMERCIAL LINES in orientation and is  
composed of two or more of the following coverages: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, BUSINESS CRIME, BUSINESS  
AUTOMOBILE, BOILER AND MACHINERY, COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY (CGL), INLAND  
MARINE INSURANCE, and FARMOWNERS and RANCHOWNERS INSURANCE.  
COMMERCIAL POLICY see COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE.  
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FLOATER means of providing insurance protection for the property of a business that is  
not at a fixed location.  
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FORM ENDORSEMENT to the STANDARD FIRE POLICY increasing the insurance  
protection to an ALL RISKS basis.  
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY POLICY coverage for business risks including goods in transit, fire, burglary, and theft.  
A common example is the COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY (CPP).  
COMMINGLED TRUST FUND pooling of assets of two or more pension funds under common portfolio management.  
COMMISSION fee paid to an insurance salesperson as a percentage of the premium generated by a sold insurance  
policy.  
COMMISSION, CONTINGENT COMMISSION that is paid based on how profitable a particular type of business  
proves to be that is written by an AGENT.  
COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE (INSURANCE COMMISSIONER, SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE) top  
state regulator of the insurance business who is either elected to office or appointed by a state to safeguard the interests  
of policyowners.  
COMMISSIONERS ANNUITY RESERVE VALUATION METHOD (CARVM) term for statutory reserves for  
annuities that can be calculated using various methods but at the minimum, the reserve must be at least equal to the  
CARVM. The CARVM equals the greatest present value of future guaranteed benefits to include NONFORFEITURE  
BENEFITS in excess of future required premiums. Not included in this calculation are expenses and policy lapses.  
COMMISSIONERS STANDARD INDUSTRIAL MORTALITY TABLE (CSI) table used in calculating various  
nonforfeiture values for industrial life insurance policies. These tables give the minimum values that must be generated  
to the policyowner. The insured's life expectancy, according to the Commissioners Standard Industrial Mortality Table,  
is shorter than the life expectancy given in ordinary life tables such as the COMMISSIONERS STANDARD  
ORDINARY MORTALITY  
< previous page page_97 next page >  
 
< previous page page_98 next page >  
Page 98  
TABLE (CSO). Thus the Industrial Mortality Table's premiums are relatively higher than those based on the CSO  
Table. This is because the life expectancy of purchasers of industrial policies tends on average to be less than that of  
people who buy ordinary life policies.  
COMMISSIONERS STANDARD ORDINARY MORTALITY TABLE (CSO) table used in calculating minimum  
nonforfeiture values and policy reserves for ordinary life insurance policies. These tables, which give minimum values  
that must be guaranteed to policy-owners as approved by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS (NAIC), depict the number of people dying each year out of the original population, not as  
individuals, but in age groups.  
COMMISSIONERS VALUES specific values of securities computed annually by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) as guidelines and procedures for insurance companies in listing of their  
securities in their annual statements. Values are the same for all insurers. This gives insurance commissioners a basis for  
valuing securities and ensuring that a company has sufficient assets to back up the reserve requirements.  
COMMISSION OF AUTHORITY powers of an AGENT delegated by an insurance company and shown in the form of  
a document.  
COMMITMENT insurance company's promise to insure particular risks.  
COMMON CARRIER transportation firm that must carry any customer's goods if the customer is willing to pay.  
Common carriers include trucking companies, bus lines, and airlines. See also INLAND MARINE INSURANCE.  
COMMON DISASTER CLAUSE (SURVIVORSHIP CLAUSE) wording in life insurance policies to determine the  
order of deaths when the insured and the beneficiary die in the same accident. For example, if the insured is deemed to  
have died first, the proceeds are payable to a named contingent beneficiary. Otherwise, the proceeds are payable to the  
insured's estate and are subject to probate and other legal fees.  
COMMON LAW legal system in the United States, Great Britain, and other countries. Inherited from England, it is  
based on case decisions acting as the precedent, not on written law. See also STATUTORY LIABILITY.  
COMMON LAW DEFENSES arguments composed of ASSUMPTION OF RISK, CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE,  
and FELLOW SERVANT RULE.

COMMUNITY PROPERTY all property acquired after marriage, deemed to be the result of the joint efforts of both  
spouses (regardless of whether or not only one spouse has earned income). Each spouse is entitled to one half of the  
property. Community property states are Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma,  
Texas, and Washington.  
COMMUTATION in LIFE INSURANCE, the exchange of a series of installment payments, as the result of an  
INSTALLMENT SETTLEMENT, for a LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION.  
COMMUTATION RIGHT right of a BENEFICIARY of a LIFE INSURANCE POLICY to exchange the future  
installments due that beneficiary for a LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION.  
COMMUTE see COMMUTATION RIGHT.  
COMMUTED VALUE see COMMUTATION RIGHT.  
COMPANY ORGANIZATION see INSURANCE COMPANY ORGANIZATION.  
COMPARATIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD see LINTON YIELD METHOD.  
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE in some states, principle of tort law providing that in the event of an accident each  
party's negligence is based on that party's contribution to the accident. For example, if in an auto accident both parties  
fail to obey the yield sign, their negligence would be equal, and neither would collect legal damages from the other.  
COMPENSATING BALANCES PLAN premium paid by an insured business to an insurance company from which the  
company subtracts charges for the cost of putting a policy on its books, premium taxes, and profit. The remainder of the  
premium is deposited in the insured business's bank account from which the insured business can make withdrawals.  
COMPENSATORY DAMAGES see LIABILITY, CIVIL DAMAGES AWARDED.  
COMPETENCE capacity of parties to an insurance contract to under-stand the meanings of their action in order for the  
contract to be valid.  
COMPETITIVE STATE FUND see MONOPOLISTIC STATE FUND.

COMPLETION BOND protection for a mortgagee guaranteeing that the mortgagor will complete construction. The  
mortgagee (such as a savings and loan association) lends money to the mortgagor (the owner of the project) in order to  
pay the contractor who is actually physically building the project. Upon completion, the project then serves to secure the  
loan. Should the project not be completed, the mortgagee is protected through the completion bond.  
COMPOUND INTEREST accumulation of interest yearly or more frequently, including interest paid on interest.  
COMPOUND PROBABILITY theory that the PROBABILITY that two independent events will occur is equal to the  
probability that one independent event will occur times the probability that a second INDEPENDENT EVENT will  
occur. For example, on a single toss of two dimes (each dime having a head and a tail), the probability that both will  
land on their tails is equal to 1/4 (1/2 x 1/2).  
COMPREHENSIVE AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE see AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE;  
COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE.  
COMPREHENSIVE CRIME ENDORSEMENT attachment to a COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY to cover

Independent contractors coverage for bodily injury incurred as the result of negligent acts and omissions of an  
independent contractor employed by the insured.  
COMPREHENSIVE GLASS INSURANCE coverage on an ALL RISKS basis for glass breakage, subject to exclusions  
of war and fire. Thus, if a vandal throws a brick through a window of an insured's establishment, the coverage would  
apply.  
COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE complete coverage for hospital and physician charges subject to  
deductibles and coinsurance. This coverage combines basic medical expense policy and major medical policy. See also  
GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE; HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO).  
COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE coverage in automobile insurance providing protection in the event of physical  
damage (other than COLLISION) or theft of the insured car. For example, fire damage to an insured car would be  
covered under the comprehensive section of the PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP).  
COMPREHENSIVE LIABILITY INSURANCE policy providing businesses with coverage for negligence based civil  
liability in: (1) Bodily injury and property damage liability, on an occurrence basis, resulting from the ownership, use,  
and/or maintenance of the premises, completed operations and products. (2) Bodily injury and property damage liability  
for operation of an elevator. (3) Medical expenses resulting from bodily injury incurred by a member of the general  
public through the use of the premises or involvement in the operations. Medical expense reimbursement of the business

INSURANCE; HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO).  
COMPREHENSIVE MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT insurance policy designed to provide coverage for the  
DEDUCTIBLE amount and the COINSURANCE amount required to be paid by the MEDICARE recipient. Some of

Page 102  
activities, and miscellaneous events such as someone tripping in an insured's cemetery plot.  
COMPREHENSIVE POLICY combination of several coverages to protect the insured. For example, the  
COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE policy combines the basic hospital plan with MAJOR MEDICAL  
INSURANCE to cover medical expenses (room, board, surgical, and physician expenses) and miscellaneous expenses  
(surgical dressings, drugs, ambulance services, blood, and operating room). Many policies have a maximum lifetime  
limit of $1 million for the insured and for each member of the insured's family who is a dependent resident of the  
insured's household. The COMPREHENSIVE PERSONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE policy covers the insured for  
just about any negligent act or omission that results in property damage or bodily injury to another party, subject to the  
exclusions of automotive liability and professional liability. The SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP) policy  
provides the businessowner with comprehensive property damage coverage on an ALL RISKS basis.  
COMPREHENSIVE THEFT, DISAPPEARANCE, AND DESTRUCTION INSURANCE see THEFT,  
DISAPPEARANCE, AND DESTRUCTION POLICY (FORM C).

minimum amounts of automobile liability insurance that must be carried. See also FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  
LAW.  
COMPULSORY RETIREMENT AGE mandatory age of retirement.  
CONCEALMENT intention to withhold or secrete information. If an insured withholds information on a material fact,  
about which the insurance company has no knowledge, the company has grounds to void the contract. For example, the  
insured neglects to tell the company that, within a week of the policy issue date, the manufacture of gunpowder in the  
insured business's building will commence. If an explosion related to the gunpowder then occurs in the building the  
company has legal grounds for not paying for the property damage.  
CONCURRENCY circumstance in which at least two insurance policies provide identical coverage for the same risk.  
See also DOUBLE RECOVERY.  
CONCURRENT CAUSATION loss caused by two or more perils. A certain amount of controversy exists when one of  
the perils is insured and the other peril is excluded from coverage. Some courts are begin-  
< previous page page_102 next page >  
 
< previous page page_103 next page >  
Page 103  
ning to find that even if only one of the perils is insured against, the policy providing the coverage for that peril must  
pay the damages.  
CONCURRENT INSURANCE see CONCURRENCY.  
CONDITION action(s) that the insured must take, or continue to take, for the insurance policy to remain in force and  
the insurance company to process a claim. For example, the insured must pay the premiums when due, notify the  
insurance company as soon as possible in the case of an accident, and cooperate with the company in defense of the  
insured in case of a liability suit.  
CONDITIONAL terms specifying obligations of an insured to keep a policy in force. For example, an insured must pay  
the premiums due; in life insurance, if death occurs, the beneficiary or the insured's estate must submit proof of death; if  
there is a property loss, the insured must submit proof of loss.  
CONDITIONAL BINDING RECEIPT see BINDING RECEIPT; CONDITIONAL RECEIPT.  
CONDITIONAL INSURANCE see CONDITIONAL SALES FLOATER.  
CONDITIONAL RECEIPT evidence of a temporary contract obliging a life or health insurance company to provide  
coverage as long as a premium accompanies an acceptable application. This gives the company time to process the  
application and to issue or refuse a policy, as the case may be. If the applicant were to die before a policy is issued, the  
company will pay the death benefit if the policy would have been issued. For example, Mr. A applies for $100,000 of  
life insurance but is killed by an automobile before the policy is issued. The company finds that it would have issued the  
policy, and therefore pays $100,000 to the beneficiary. See also BINDING RECEIPT.  
CONDITIONAL RENEWABLE HEALTH INSURANCE automatic right of an insured to renew a policy until a given  
date or age except under stated conditions. It is extremely important for the purchaser to review the conditions for  
renewal in order to make sure of their acceptability.  
CONDITIONAL SALES FLOATER coverage for the seller of property on an installment or conditional sales contract  
if it is damaged or destroyed. For example, a television set is sold on an installment basis but is destroyed by a  
customer. The seller would be indemnified for the loss.  
CONDITIONAL VESTING see VESTING, CONDITIONAL.  
CONDITION PRECEDENT contractual obligation that requires one party to the contract to fulfill its obligation before  
another party to the contract is required to fulfill its contractual obligation. For example, under the HOMEOWNERS  
INSURANCE POLICY, in the event the insured suffers a property loss, that insured must provide the insurer with  
immediate  
< previous page page_103 next page >  
 
< previous page page_104 next page >  
Page 104  
notice of the loss as well as an inventory of the damaged property within 60 days of the occurrence of the loss.  
CONDITIONS FOR QUALIFICATION rights and duties of an insured as a prerequisite for collecting benefits. For  
example, in the event of property damage, the insured may be required to submit proof of loss to the insurance company.  
CONDITION SUBSEQUENT termination of a contractual obligation for immediate performance. For example, under  
the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, if the INSURER refuses to pay a claim, the INSURED (if not satisfied  
with the reason) must bring suit against the insured within one year of having incurred the loss or he/she will forgo  
forever the right to sue the insurer.  
CONDOMINIUM INSURANCE coverage under the Homeowners Form-4 (HO-4) for the insured's personal property  
and loss of use against fire and/or lightning; vandalism and/or malicious mischief; windstorm and/or hail; explosion, riot  
and/or civil commotion; vehicles; aircraft; smoke; falling objects; weight of ice, sleet, and/or snow; volcanic eruption;  
damage from artificially generated electricity; freezing of plumbing, heating, air conditioning or sprinkler system or  
household appliances; accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system, air  
conditioning system, or an automatic fire protective sprinkler system.  
CONFIDENCE LEVEL percentage of confidence in a finding. For example, if an insurance company's total LOSS  
RESERVES should be $10,000,000 in order to attain an 80% confidence level that enough money will be available to  
pay anticipated claims, then, in 8 times out of 10, after all claims have been settled the total claims paid out will be less  
than $10,000,000. Conversely, in 2 times out of 10 the total claims paid out will be greater than $10,000,000. In another  
example, a 70% confidence level of one's house burning would mean that the house would burn approximately once  
every 3.33 years [1 � (1 0.70) = 3.33].  
CONFINING CONDITION term describing illness, sickness, or disability incurred by the insured such that the insured  
is restricted to his or her home, a hospital, or a nursing home. Many HEALTH INSURANCE policies provide benefits  
only if the insured is restricted in such a manner.  
CONFLAGRATION fire that spreads substantial destruction.  
CONFUSION OF GOODS peril that occurs when personal property of two or more people is mixed to such an extent  
that any one owner can no longer identify his or her property.  
CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS value of loss resulting from loss of use of property. For example, a fire damages the  
structure of business premises and the business loses customer income until it can reopen. The loss in incomethe  
consequential losscan be covered under  
< previous page page_104 next page >

Page 105  
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE. Basic property insurance policies, such as the fire policy, do not cover the  
consequential or indirect loss.  
CONSERVATION effort to keep life insurance policies from lapsing. Many life insurance companies have  
conservation officers who contact lapsing policyowners explaining the benefits of keeping their policies in force. Often,  
the AGENT OF RECORD is notified of policies in danger or in process of lapsing so that the agent may also contact the  
policyowner.  
CONSERVATOR court-appointed or COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE-appointed custodian to manage the affairs  
of an insurance company whose management is deemed unable to manage that company in a proper fashion. Usually  
such a company faces INSOLVENCY prior to the appointment of the conservator.  
CONSIDERATION  
1. under contract law, anything of value exchanged for a promise or for performance that is needed to make an  
instrument binding on the contracting parties.  
2. adherence to all provisions of an insurance policy by an insured; for example, the insured agrees to make all premium  
payments when due in order to maintain a policy in full force.  
3. payment for an annuity. See also INSURANCE CONTRACT, LIFE; INSURANCE CONTRACT, PROPERTY AND  
CASUALTY.  
CONSIGNMENT INSURANCE coverage for items that are on consignment, including exhibits, goods up for auction,  
and goods awaiting someone's approval. The stipulation for coverage is that these items cannot be under the care,  
custody, and control of the owner.  
CONSOLIDATED CAPTIVE consolidation of a noninsurance parent company with its wholly owned subsidiary,  
thereby creating, allowable under current tax law, a consolidated balance sheet. This consolidation of balance sheets  
permits the offsetting of UNDERWRITING LOSSES with taxable income of a noninsurance subsidiary.  
CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1985, 1986, AND 1990 (COBRA) act that  
mandates that employers who have at least 26 employees must provide a terminating employee and family members, if  
residents of employee's household, with health insurance coverage for periods of time ranging from 18 to 36 months  
after termination. The continued coverages end prior to the 18 to 36 months if: (1) employer terminates all group health  
plans; (2) insured qualifies for Medicare; (3) insured becomes covered under another group health insurance plan that is  
not subject to any preexisting conditions; and (4) required premium payments are not made when due. The employer  
cannot require the employee to submit EVIDENCE OF INSURABILITY as a condition for continuing the health  
insurance coverage, nor can the employee be required to pay more than a premium of 102% of the plan for coverage of  
same situated individuals.

CONSORTIUM UNDERWRITING method of underwriting by which one or a group of LLOYD'S UNDERWRITERS  
write business on behalf of a number of Lloyd's syndicates and other insurance companies. Among the benefits of  
underwriting in this manner are that potential earnings could equal the SYNDICATE'S expenses and stabilize the  
planning of staff as well as other general overhead requirements.  
CONSTRUCTION BOND see BID BOND; COMPLETION BOND; LABOR AND MATERIAL BOND;  
MAINTENANCE BOND; SURETY BOND.  
CONSTRUCTION INSURANCE property coverage for damage or destruction of structures in the course of  
construction. For example, the standing frame of a house destroyed by fire would be covered. See also BUILDER'S  
RISK PROPERTY INSURANCE.  
CONSTRUCTIVE RECEIPT specific date determined by the Internal Revenue Service on which a beneficiary has  
received a death benefit from an insurance company, an ANNUITANT has received an income benefit, or a retiree has  
received a retirement benefit.  
CONSTRUCTIVE TOTAL LOSS partial loss of such significance that the cost of restoring damaged property would  
exceed its value after restoration. For example, an automobile is so badly damaged by fire that fixing it would cost more  
than the restored vehicle would be worth.  
CONSULTANT in insurance, independent advisor who specializes in pension and profit sharing plans. Usually a  
licensed insurance agent.  
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX measurement of how people feel about prevailing economic conditions,  
employment outlook, and personal finances. This index is based on statistics gathered from questionnaires mailed by the  
Conference Board to a nationwide representative sample of 5000 households, with a response rate of 70%.  
CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION ACT 1968 federal legislation that makes it mandatory for lenders to disclose to  
credit applicants the annual interest percentage rate (APR) and any finance charge.  
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI) measurement of the rate of inflation according to a weighted market basket of  
goods and services that includes such items as transportation costs, health care costs, housing costs, and food costs.  
These statistics are released monthly by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.  
CONSUMER PRODUCTS SAFETY ACT OF 1972 act that established mandatory notification by manufacturers of  
products and the distributors of these products to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the event they become  
aware of a faulty product, or part of that product, that could result in bodily injury and/or property damage.

to the building's structure (the home), such as television sets, radios, clothes, household goods. Not included under the  
coverage are animals, automobiles, and boats.  
2. in COMMERCIAL PROPERTY insurance, coverage is for the business's personal property items that are movable,  
that is, not attached to the building's structure such as inventory, machinery, equipment, furniture, and fixtures. Not

CONTINGENCY event that may or may not occur in a given time period. For example, whether a specific person will  
die, or a particular house will burn this year is a contingency.  
CONTINGENCY RESERVE percentage of total surplus retained, in insurance company operations, that serves as a  
reserve to cover unexpected losses as well as to cover the shortfall if the earned surplus in a particular year is not  
adequate to maintain a company's announced dividend scale for participating policies.

CONTINGENT BUSINESS INCOME COVERAGE FORM coverage for loss in the net earnings of a business if a  
supplier business, sub-contractor, key customer, or manufacturer doing business with the insured business cannot  
continue to operate because of damage or destruction. For example, a specialty hot dog stand noted for its great buns  
cannot sell its product if the bakery supplier of hot dog buns burns down. In instances where a business is heavily  
dependent on its suppliers or subcontractors, interruption of the flow of material from the supplier usually results in a  
substantial loss to the business.

from 30 to 50% of the case settlement or reward.  
CONTINGENT LIABILITY (VICARIOUS LIABILITY) liability incurred by a business for acts other than those of its  
own employees. This particular situation may arise when an independent contractor is hired. The business can be held  
liable for negligent acts of the contractor to the extent that its representatives give directions or exercise control over the  
contractor's employees.  
CONTINGENT LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for contingent liability exposure. See CONTINGENT  
LIABILITY.  
CONTINGENT TRANSIT INSURANCE coverage if an insured cannot collect on property damage or destruction  
losses from the hired transporter. For example, a truck transporting furniture of the insured is involved in an accident  
and the furniture is damaged. The truck owner refuses to compensate the insured for damages; the recourse of the  
insured is to collect from the insurance company.  
CONTINUANCE TABLE table used in health insurance premium rate calculations that depicts the probability that a

CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY retirement center with a focus on group living arrangements for  
senior citizens. The center has separate apartments for each resident as well as an on-site nursing facility. Generally,  
these centers are quite expensive; they require monthly fees as well as a one-time payment (entrance fee). The monthly  
fee entitles the inhabitant to an apartment, one to three meals a day (depending on the facility), maid service (in some  
facilities), medical service (if needed), and nursing home care (also, if needed).

perform according to the specifications of the construction contract. If the contractor fails to perform according to  
contract, the insurance company is responsible to the insured for payment, up to the limit of the bond, which is usually  
for an amount equal to the cost of the construction project. The insurance company then has recourse against the  
contractor for reimbursement. See also BID BOND; PAYMENT BOND; PERFORMANCE BOND.

CONTRIBUTING PROPERTY BUSINESS INCOME COVERAGE FORM that covers an insured business in the  
event that a manufacturer's operations are interrupted or suspended, thereby resulting in a monetary loss because a  
supplier of the insured has had his facility damaged or destroyed by an insured peril. See also CONTINGENT  
BUSINESS INCOME COVERAGE FORM.  
CONTRIBUTION principle of equity in property, casualty, and health insurance. When two or more policies apply to  
the loss, each policy pays its part of the loss, unless its terms provide otherwise. For example, if two policies each insure  
a risk for $100,000 and there is a $50,000 loss, then each policy (depending on coinsurance requirements) will pay  
$25,000. In employee benefits, payment made by an employee.  
CONTRIBUTION CLAUSE clause, generally found in BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, that establishes  
the same indemnification basis as the COINSURANCE clause.  
CONTRIBUTION PRINCIPLE rule that concerns the distribution of the aggregate SURPLUS among the policies in the  
same proportion as each respective policy has contributed to the surplus.  
CONTRIBUTORY employee benefit plans under which both the employee and the employer pay part of the premium.  
Contribution ratios vary. For example, an employer contributes two dollars for every dollar contributed by the employee  
up to 6% of the employee's salary.  
CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE principle of law recognizing that injured persons may have contributed to their own  
injury. For example, by not observing the "Don't Walk" sign at a crosswalk, pedestrians may cause accidents in which

CONVERSION  
1. tort against another person's property, designed to detain or dispose of it in a wrongful manner. For example,  
wrongful selling of another person's automobile without permission would qualify as an act of conversion.  
2. in group life and health insurance, a provision that allows a certificate holder to convert group coverage to an  
individual policy under specified conditions.  
CONVERSION FACTOR FOR EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS inverse of the actuarial present value of a life  
annuity, taking the employee's life expectancy into account, to commence income payments at the NORMAL  
RETIREMENT AGE of the employee. It is used in a DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN to determine the amount of accrued  
benefits that result from the employee's contributions.  
CONVERSION PRIVILEGE right of a certificate holder to convert group life or group health insurance to an individual  
policy without a physical examination to furnish evidence of insurability. Usually this must be done within 31 days of  
termination of employment. Under group life insurance, conversion is made at the employee's attained age rate, which  
can be prohibitively costly in later years. Many term life insurance policies can be converted to a whole life policy at the  
insured's attained age, with no physical examination required.  
CONVERTIBLE see CONVERTIBLE TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
CONVERTIBLE TERM LIFE INSURANCE coverage that can be converted into permanent insurance regardless of an  
insured's physical condition and without a medical examination. The individual cannot be denied coverage or charged  
an additional premium for any health problems.  
COOPERATIVE INSURANCE see SOCIAL INSURANCE.  
COOPERATIVE INSURER mutual insurance association that issues insurance to its members on a nonprofit basis.  
Examples of such associations include fraternal societies, unions, and employee membership groups.  
COORDINATION OF BENEFITS arrangement in health insurance to discourage multiple payment for the same claim  
under two or more policies. When two or more group health insurance plans cover the insured and dependents, one plan  
becomes the primary plan and the other plan(s) the secondary plan(s). For example, two working spouses have health  
insurance at their respective places of employment. If one spouse becomes ill, his/her policy at work would become the  
primary plan. Medical expenses not covered under the primary plan would be covered under the secondary plan of the  
other spouse. See also COINSURANCE.  
< previous page page_111 next page >  
 
< previous page page_112 next page >  
Page 112  
COPAYMENT partial payment of medical service expenses required in group health insurance, in addition to the  
membership fee. For example, for each visit of a physician a member may be required to pay $5, regardless of the  
expense of the services rendered. Or, for each prescription for drugs and medicines, the member may have to pay a flat  
$2 regardless of the actual cost.  
CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX: IMPLICATIONS FOR CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE  
INSURANCE tax that exhibits direct impact on the book income preference. Beginning with the year 1990, the book  
income preference became equal to 75% of the excess of current adjusted earnings of the alternative minimum taxable  
income (AMTI). Book income preferences are affected by corporate-owned life insurance in the following situations:  
1. If the insured dies, the excess of the life insurance policy's DEATH BENEFIT over the CASH SURRENDER  
VALUE becomes book income to the corporation.  
2. If the insurance policy's annual premium exceeds the increase in the cash surrender value for a particular year, the  
result is a decline in the book income and thus a decline in the corporation's exposure to the alternative minimum tax  
(AMT).  
3. Conversely, if the insurance policy's cash surrender value exceeds the increase in the annual premium for a particular  
year, the result is an increase in the book income and thus an increase in the corporation's exposure to the alternative  
minimum tax.  
Generally, if the corporation in any given year has taxable income, corporate-owned life insurance results in an  
alternative minimum tax liability if a significant death benefit is paid to the corporation upon the death of the insured.  
The result is that the alternative minimum tax will cause a reduction in the net death benefit from the life insurance  
policy paid to the corporation.  
CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE insurance on the life of the employee, paid for by the company, with the  
company being the beneficiary under the policy. This insurance vehicle is being used more and more to fund  
postretirement employee plans, in which the cash values are listed as assets on the company's balance sheet.  
CORPORATION STOCK PURCHASE PLAN see CLOSE CORPORATION PLAN.  
CORRIDOR the space created between the total death benefit and the cash value of a UNIVERSAL LIFE  
INSURANCE policy. An automatic increase in the death benefit results when the CASH VALUE approaches the initial  
face amount under Option A. If this space did not exist, the universal life insurance policy would not qualify as a life  
insurance policy under the definition of life insurance by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and would cease to reap the  
favorable tax treatment afforded life insurance policies by the IRC.  
< previous page page_112 next page >  
 
< previous page page_113 next page >  
Page 113  
CORRIDOR DEDUCTIBLE type of major medical deductible amount that acts as a corridor between benefits under a  
basic health insurance plan and benefits under a major medical insurance plan. After benefits are paid under the basic  
plan, a fixed dollar per-loss deductible amount often is required of the insured (benefits paid under the basic plan do not  
apply towards this deductible) before major medical benefits are paid.  
COST see PREMIUM, PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD.  
COST ALLOCATION METHOD method of funding a pension plan through: (1) an individual level cost basis, where  
future benefits for the employee are estimated and contributions are made periodically while the employee is working to  
fund these future benefits; or (2) an aggregate level cost basis, where future benefits for all current employees are  
estimated and aggregate contributions are made periodically while the current employees are working to fund these  
future benefits.  
COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS comparison of the cost of a solution and the economic benefits that would accrue if the  
solution is put into effect. This analysis is a prerequisite to the installation of an employee benefit plan. Questions to be  
answered include: (1) will the cost result in greater loyalty of employees? (2) will the cost result in greater productivity;  
and (3) will the benefits encourage employees to participate in their cost?  
COST CONTAINMENT PROVISION in many HEALTH INSURANCE and DENTAL INSURANCE policies,  
stipulation that, if the estimated cost of a recommended plan of treatment exceeds a specified sum, the insured must  
submit the plan of treatment to the insurance company for review and predetermination of benefits before service  
begins. Usually, however, predetermination of benefits is not necessary for emergency treatment.  
COST OF INSURANCE value or cost of the actual net protection, in life insurance, in any year (face amount less  
reserve) according to the yearly renewal term rate used by an insurance company. See also INTEREST ADJUSTED  
COST.  
COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT (COLA) automatic adjustment applied to Social Security retirement payments  
when the consumer price index increases at a rate of at least 3%, the first quarter of one year to the first quarter of the  
next year. See also RIDERS, LIFE POLICIES.  
COST-OF-LIVING INCREASE see COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT (COLA); COST-OF-LIVING RIDER.  
COST-OF-LIVING PLAN plan providing benefits that are adjusted according to variations in a specified index of  
prices. For example, some pension plans adjust retirement benefits yearly according to the rise in the Consumer Price  
Index (CPI).  
< previous page page_113 next page >

Page 114  
COST-OF-LIVING RIDER usually term insurance for one year added to a basic life insurance policy. In effect, this  
increases or decreases the face amount of the basic policy to reflect cost-of-living changes as measured by the  
Consumer Price Index (CPI). This rider can also be used in conjunction with a disability income policy in which the  
income benefit is adjusted to reflect fluctuations in the CPI.  
COST OF LOSS see EXPECTED LOSS.  
COST OF PROTECTION see COST OF INSURANCE; PREMIUM; PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD.  
COST OF RISK (COR) quantitative measurement of the total costs (losses, risk control costs, risk financing costs, and  
administration costs) associated with the RISK MANAGEMENT function, as compared to a business's sales, assets, and  
number of employees. The purpose of such a comparison is to determine whether the total costs of the risk management  
function are increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant as a function of the business's economic activity. After the  
quantitative measurement has been derived, a comparison can be made between the COR of that business and the CORs  
of its peer groups. In addition, COR will allow the business to focus on the areas of operation that will have the greatest  
long-term effects on its total risk management function costs.  
COST PLUS insured plan under which the insurance company agrees to provide the insured with a series of benefits on  
a benefits-paid basis plus administrative services on a stipulated-fee basis. This plan enables the POLICYHOLDER to  
control more of its own cash flow than it can under traditional insurance plans. While this plan is similar to the  
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ONLY (ASO) plan, it is dissimilar in that it is an insured plan.  
COTTON INSURANCE coverage for property damage by a covered peril to insured cotton during the time period from  
its weighing in at the gin until its delivery to the buyer. Written either on a specified peril basis or on an ALL RISKS  
basis. The purpose of cotton insurance is much the same as the purchase of insurance by a merchant to protect business  
inventory prior to its sale, since in many instances the primary asset is the inventory.  
COUNTERSIGNATURE licensed AGENT'S signature on an insurance policy.  
COUNTERSIGNATURE LAW state law that requires that an insurance policy issued by an insurance company in a  
particular state be signed by an AGENT of the company holding a LICENSE in that state.  
COUPON fixed or stated amount of interest paid by a security expressed as a percent of the par value of the security.  
The longer the length of time until maturity, the higher the coupon rate to reflect the greater risk associated with a  
longer loan period. The higher the creditworthiness  
< previous page page_114 next page >  
 
< previous page page_115 next page >  
Page 115  
of the borrower, the lower the coupon rate. For example, United States Treasury issues have a low coupon rate because  
the United States has a long history of political and economic stability.  
COUPON POLICY nonparticipating life insurance (also called a guaranteed dividend or guaranteed investment policy)  
sold by a stock life insurance company, usually as a 20-payment policy with coupons attached. The policyowner can  
cash in each coupon (which is actually one of a series of pure endowments) for a stipulated sum at the time of paying  
the annual premium.

CREDIT INVESTIGATION see RETAIL CREDIT REPORT.  
CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE (CREDITOR LIFE INSURANCE) insurance issued to a creditor (lender) to cover the life  
of a debtor (borrower) for an outstanding loan. If the debtor dies prior to repayment of the debt, the policy will pay off  
the balance of the amount outstanding. Credit life insurance is sold on a group or individual basis, and usually is  
purchased to cover small loans of short duration. When issued under a group policy, a certificate is issued to the debtor,  
the master policy being issued by the creditor. The face value of a credit life insurance policy decreases in proportion to  
the reduction in the loan amount until both equal zero.

CREDIT, PENSION PLAN value of benefit or contribution allocated to an employee under a pension plan; method of  
determining benefits due a retired employee. Each private pension plan establishes rules for awarding credits to  
employees, taking into account age, amount of time with the employer, number of days worked per year, breaks in  
service, maximum salary, and position in the company. For an employee who joined a firm before the plan was put in  
place, the company computes past service credit, crediting work done prior to establishment of the plan. Ultimately,  
credits determine the level of pension income the employee receives upon retiring.  
CREDIT RECEIVABLE RISK risk that PREMIUMS and REINSURANCE, as well as other receivable instruments,  
will not be collected.  
CREDIT REPORT see RETAIL CREDIT REPORT.  
CREDIT RISK possibility that a borrower will not be able to service the debt (pay the interest on the borrowed funds)  
or make the principal payments when due. The greater this type of risk, the greater the yield.  
CREDIT SHELTER TRUST vehicle through which the FEDERAL ESTATE TAX credit is protected from estate tax  
payment. The procedure is to leave the federal estate tax credit to the shelter trust with the trust established for the  
benefit of one's spouse (spouse receives the income from the trust and the assets of the trust are held for the benefit of  
the spouse). The assets of the trust are not subject to federal estate tax upon the death of the spouse since the assets are  
not in the spouse's estate at that time.  
CRIME INSURANCE coverage for the perils of burglary, theft, and robbery. See also BURGLARY INSURANCE;  
BUSINESS INSURANCE; HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY; PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP);  
SIMPLIFIED COMMERCIAL LINES PORTFOLIO POLICY (SCLP); COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY (CPP).  
CRIMINAL LIABILITY crime against the state for which an officer of the state can bring legal action. Society is  
harmed by an individual breaking the laws of the state. Usually there is no statue of limitations for criminal liability.  
Property and casualty insurance is not designed to provide coverage for the criminal acts of an insured individual.  
CRITICAL ILLNESS INSURANCE insurance policy that pays a FACE AMOUNT/ LUMP SUM if the INSURED is  
diagnosed with a specified critical illness. This sum is paid directly to the insured regardless of any other sources of  
income (job-related and non-job-related), expenses incurred (medical and nonmedical), and any other factors.  
Generally, critical illnesses include stroke, heart attack, cancer that is life threatening, paralysis, deafness, organ  
transplant requirement, blindness, and kidney failure. Some policies pay a percentage of the face amount, for  
< previous page page_117 next page >  
 
< previous page page_118 next page >  
Page 118  
example 15 to 30%, if a less serious illness occurs or medical procedure such as a coronary bypass must be performed.  
The illness does not have to result in the disability of the insured (total or partial); the insured still receives the face  
amount payment. This type of insurance can be purchased as a separate policy or as a rider to a LIFE INSURANCE or  
DISABILITY INCOME policy. The face amount is not paid if the insured dies within 30 days of being diagnosed with  
the covered illness and there is usually a WAITING PERIOD before the coverage is in force. This coverage may be  
purchased on both a personal and business basis.  
CROP INSURANCE coverage for crops in the event of loss or damage by insured perils including hail, fire, and  
lightning. Prior to the passage of the Federal Crop Insurance Act in 1938 it was virtually impossible to obtain insurance  
protection against crop damage. Today coverage is available from the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation as well as  
from private sources. Exclusions from coverage include the perils of war and nuclear disaster.  
CROSS LIABILITY LIABILITY incurred by one INSURED as the result of his or her damaging another insured when  
both insureds are covered under the same LIABILITY INSURANCE policy. Each insured must be treated as a separate  
entity under a cross-liability clause in a liability insurance policy.  
CROSS PURCHASE PLAN see PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE.  
CRUDE DEATH RATE total deaths as a percentage of total population for a stipulated period of time.  
CRUMMEY TRUST unfunded trust that acts as the owner of a life insurance policy. The trust receives a donor's cash  
payments on a periodic basis, from which the beneficiary of the trust has a specified period in which to make a cash  
withdrawal. If this is not done, the cash paid by the donor is used to pay the premiums due on the life insurance policy.  
Under this circumstance the IRS deems that a gift of present value interest by the donor has been made. It is important  
that a gift of present value interest be established because such a gift in trust will enable the donor to contribute up to  
$10,000 ($20,000 if two donors such as husband and wife contribute) in premium payments and enjoy the gift tax  
exclusion. When the donor dies, the life insurance policy in trust is effectively removed from the donor's estate.

CUMULATIVE LIABILITY  
Reinsurance: total of the limits of liability of all reinsurance policies that a reinsurer has outstanding on a single risk.  
The total of all such limits includes all ceding contracts from all insurers representing all lines of coverage for the single  
risk.  
Liability insurance: total of the limits of liability of all policies that an insurer has outstanding on a single risk.  
Examples are the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP), and  
personal umbrella liability policy.  
CUMULATIVE TRAUMA injury that continues after a wound from physical or psychic entry. (The latter is a wound  
that makes a lasting impression on the mind, especially upon the subconscious mind; for example, a three-year-old child  
could be traumatized by seeing father abuse mother.) Trauma results in other injuries of a continuing nature and is  
usually covered under health insurance policies.  
CUMULATIVE TRAUMA DISORDERS injuries that afflict the tendons, bones, muscles, and nerves of the back,  
hands, arm, shoulders, and neck. These are the fastest growing areas of workers compensation claims. The symptoms of  
these injuries range from swelling and deformity to intense pain and numbness.  
CUMULATIVE TREND METHOD approach to derive trend lines that can be applied to rating insured losses. Other  
methods require substantial preliminary operations to solve systems of equations of several unknowns. The cumulative  
method reduces the probability of mistakes because a relatively simple computation is required to prepare a set of data  
for the BURNING COST RATIO.  
CURE see REST CURE.  
CURRENCY RISK situation where the United States dollar rises in value in comparison with other foreign currencies  
resulting in the decrease in the value of the foreign securities. This is due to the fact that the principal and income  
payments on the foreign securities are based on that particular foreign currency and thus must be converted into United  
States dollars. When that particular foreign currency is weak, and the United States dollar is strong, fewer dollars will  
be received upon conversion.  
CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS basis for calculating life insurance premiums and benefits using current interest and  
mortality rates, rather than historic rates. Current assumptions are critical to interest-sensitive products such as  
Universal Life. When interest rates are high, benefits projections (such as cash values) are high. When interest rates are  
low, these projections are not as alluring. The thesis of current-assumption life insurance products is that policyowner  
earnings should reflect current market conditions.  
CURRENT ASSUMPTION WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE variation of ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE under which  
current mortality experience

and investment earnings are credited to the insurance policy either through the cash value account and/or the premium  
structure (in a stock company) or the dividend structure (in a mutual company). Regardless of whether a company is  
stock or mutual, the policy has these characteristics:  
1. premiums are subject to change based on the experience (mortality, expenses, investment) of the company. The  
policyowner does not exercise any control over the changes.  
2. a policyowner can use the cash value to make loans just as with traditional ordinary life insurance.  
3. a minimum amount of cash value is guaranteed, just as with traditional ordinary life insurance.  
4. the death benefit does not fluctuate.  
CURRENT DISBURSEMENT payment of premiums and benefits as they come due. In pension plans, known as the  
''pay as you go basis." The plan depends on new employees coming into the work force so that their contributions can  
help pay for the benefits of the retiring employees. If the company is not experiencing growth and is in fact part of a  
matured or even a dying industry, there may not be enough on hand to pay benefits of retiring employees.  
CURRENT INCOME average earned monthly income of the insured wage earner after regular earned income has been  
interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or accident. This income amount is important to the calculation of  
the MONTHLY INDEMNITY benefit and the LOSS OF INCOME amount under the DISABILITY INCOME  
INSURANCE policy.  
CURRENTLY INSURED under SOCIAL SECURITY, workers who have at least six quarters of earnings of adequate  
amount to qualify for credit of the last 13 quarters prior to the worker's death. If this is the case, SURVIVOR  
BENEFITS will be paid by Social Security to the dependents of the deceased worker. See also QUARTERS OF  
COVERAGE.  
CURTESY INTEREST husband's interest in his wife's property upon her death. A husband has an INSURABLE  
INTEREST in that property and can purchase a property and casualty insurance policy to cover the EXPOSURES on it.  
See also DOWER INTEREST.  
CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT account established to manage the assets of a minor. This account is under the auspices of a

CUSTODIAL CARE assistance provided to a person in performing the basic daily necessities of life, such as dressing,  
eating, using a toilet, walking, bathing, and getting in and out of bed. This type of care does not require hospitalization  
for the treatment of a disease, illness, accident, or injury. Its cost may or may not be covered by health insurance.

DEAN ANALYTIC SCHEDULE rating method for commercial fire insurance according to a predetermined schedule.  
Published by A. F. Dean in 1902, this method was the first comprehensive qualitative analysis procedure to take into  
consideration the numerous physical factors impacting the fire exposure. No longer widely used, because most  
companies have developed their own schedules or use schedules advocated by the INSURANCE SERVICES OFFICE  
(ISO).  
DEATH termination of life. A death certificate is required by a life insurance company for a beneficiary to receive the

DECEPTIVE PRACTICE CONCEALMENT of the actual fact. For example, an insurance agent tells a prospective  
insured that a policy provides a particular benefit when in actual fact this benefit is not in the written language of the  
policy. See also TWISTING.  
DECLARATION statement that the insured makes (declares) about loss exposures in an application for a policy. For  
example, in a personal automobile policy the applicant states his/her name, address, occupation, type of automobile,  
expected mileage per year, etc. Based on this information, the insurance company decides which underwriting  
classification in which to place the risk; applicable premium rate; maximum limits of coverage; and any special  
conditions to govern the insured's behavior that is to be attached to the policy.  
DECLARATIONS SECTION in property and casualty insurance, contract section containing such information as name,  
description, and location of insured property; name and address of the insured; period a policy is in force; premiums  
payable; and amount of coverage.  
DECLINATION rejection by an insurance company of an application for a policy.  
DECREASING TERM LIFE INSURANCE coverage in which the face amount of a life insurance policy declines by a  
stipulated amount over a period of time. For example, the initial face amount of a $100,000 decreasing term policy  
decreases by $10,000 each year, until after 10 years the face value equals zero. The premium does not decrease.  
DEDUCTIBILITY OF EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS contributions (under qualified employee benefit plans, such  
as pensions and health insurance) made by an employer on behalf of employees, deducted as a business expense for tax  
purposes. Employer contributions are not considered current taxable income to the employee. Thus, significant tax  
advantages are available to both an employer and an employee.  
DEDUCTIBLE amount of loss that insured pays in a claim; includes the following types:  
1. Absolute dollar amount. Amount the insured must pay before the company will pay, up to the limits of the policy.  
The higher the absolute dollar amount, the lower the premium.  
2. Time period amount (Elimination period/Waiting period). Length of time the insured must wait before any benefit  
payments are  
< previous page page_124 next page >  
 
< previous page page_125 next page >  
Page 125  
made by the insurance company. In disability income policies it is common to have a waiting period of 30 days during  
which no income benefits are paid to the insured. The longer this time period, the lower the premium.  
The consumer would be well advised to select the highest deductible (by dollar amount and/or time period) that he/she  
can afford. First dollar coverages are very costly. A high deductible allows the insured to self-insure expected  
lossesthose of high frequency and low severity.

DEDUCTIVE REASONING observance of an event occurring on a repeated basis that leads one to believe that a  
certain PROBABILITY is attached to the occurrence of that event. For example, if there are a red ball and a blue ball in  
a bag, and each color ball is drawn one-half of the time, we come to believe that each color ball has a one-half  
probability of being drawn at any one time.  
DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER oral or written statement that results in injuring the good name or reputation of  
another, causing that individual to be held in disrepute.  
DEFEASANCE procedure that moves up the maturity date of the municipal bond to its call date. The call date permits  
the issuer of the bond to redeem the bond at any time after a stipulated minimum number of years have passed at a given

DEFENSE AGAINST UNINTENTIONAL TORT see TORT, DEFENSE AGAINST UNINTENTIONAL.  
DEFENSE CLAUSE see DEMOLITION CLAUSE.  
DEFENSE COSTS expense of defending a lawsuit. To mount a legal defense against civil or criminal liability, a  
defendant faces expenses for lawyers, investigation, fact gathering, bonds, and court costs. Of critical importance in  
purchasing liability insurance is not only the limits of coverage under the policy but also the obligation of the insurance  
company to defend the insured against suits, even if a suit is without foundation. Because legal defense costs can be  
extremely high, the consumer should consider liability insurance that pays all defense costs in addition to the policy  
limits.  
DEFENSE OF SUIT AGAINST INSURED clause in a liability insurance policy under which an insurance company  
agrees to defend an insured even if a lawsuit is without foundation. The costs of defending the insured are covered, in  
addition to the limits of coverage under the policy. For example, if the limits of coverage under a policy is $1,000,000  
and defense costs are $120,000, the $120,000 costs are in addition to the $1,000,000 of coverage. This is critical, since  
defense costs can be quite high.  
DEFENSE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (DRI) organization of trial attorneys who specialize in the representation of  
defendants who become subject to TORT actions. Generally, these tort actions involve bodily injury or personal injury  
claims against the defendant.  
DEFENSIVE MEDICINE extensive medical procedures conducted by physicians in order to document the patient's file  
in the event of a negligence liability suit.  
DEFERRED ANNUITY annuity that can be paid either with a single premium or a series of installments. For example,  
an annuitant pays a single premium of $100,000 on June 1 of the current year and is scheduled to receive a monthly  
income of $1300 at a specified later date. Or, the annuitant pays $50 a month to the insurance company, starting June 1,  
1968, and ending June 1, 1987, and begins receiving a monthly income of $1300, beginning July 1, 1987. See also  
ANNUITY.  
DEFERRED BENEFITS AND PAYMENTS see DEFERRED CONTRIBUTION PLAN, DEFERRED RETIREMENT  
CREDIT.  
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN means of supplementing an executive's retirement benefits by deferring a  
portion of his or her current earnings. Deferring income in this manner encourages the loyalty  
< previous page page_126 next page >  
 
< previous page page_127 next page >  
Page 127  
of executives. To qualify for a tax advantage, the IRS requires a written agreement between an executive and the  
employer stating the spec-ified period of deferral of income. An election by an executive to defer income must be  
irrevocable and must be made prior to performing the service for which income deferral is sought.  
DEFERRED CONTRIBUTION PLAN arrangement in which an unused deduction (credit carryover) to a profit sharing  
plan can be added to an employer's future contribution on a tax deductible basis. It occurs when the employer's  
contribution to a profit sharing plan is less than the annual 15% of employee compensation allowed by the Federal Tax  
Code.  
DEFERRED DIVIDENDS end of a defined time period that dividends become payable to the POLICYHOLDER.  
DEFERRED GROUP ANNUITY retirement income payments for an employee that begin after a stipulated future time  
period, and continue for life. (A beneficiary of a deceased annuitant may receive further income, depending on whether  
the contract is a PURE ANNUITY or REFUND ANNUITY). Each year, contributions are used to buy a paid-up single  
premium deferred annuity. These increments, added together, provide income payments at retirement.  
DEFERRED PREMIUM life insurance premium that is not currently due. Future payments are made on a frequency  
basis other than annual.  
DEFERRED PROFIT-SHARING portion of company profits allocated by an employer, in good years, to an employee's  
trust. Contributions on behalf of each employee are expressed as a percentage of salary with 5% being common  
practice. If the profit sharing plan is a qualified plan according to the IRS, employer contributions are tax deductible as  
a business expense. These contributions are not currently taxable to the employee; benefits are taxed at the time of  
distribution.  
DEFERRED RETIREMENT retirement taken after the normal retirement age. For example, if the normal retirement  
age is 65 or 70 an employee may continue to work beyond those ages. Normally the election of deferred retirement does  
not increase the monthly retirement income when the employee actually retires.  
DEFERRED RETIREMENT CREDIT former arrangement under which retirement benefits payable to an employee  
who continued to work beyond NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE were frozen, and not increased in recognition of added  
work time. This was eliminated by the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.  
DEFERRED VESTING see VESTING, DEFERRED.  
DEFICIENCY RESERVE addition to reserves of a life insurance company required by various states because the  
VALUATION PREMIUM is  
< previous page page_127 next page >  
 
< previous page page_128 next page >  
Page 128  
greater than the GROSS PREMIUM. Without a deficiency reserve, the normal reserve by itself would be less than the  
actual reserve required.  
DEFICIT REDUCTION CONTRIBUTION contribution whose purpose is to increase funding of underfunded  
PENSION PLANS. It is part of the calculation that is made to arrive at the plan's minimum funding requirement.  
Usually a pension plan requires such a contribution when the assets of the plan become less than 80 to 90% of the  
current liabilities of the plan.  
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN retirement plan under which benefits are fixed in advance by formula, and contributions  
vary. The defined benefit plan can be expressed in either of two ways:  
1. Fixed Dollars: (a) Unit benefit approacha discrete unit of benefit is credited for each year of service recognized by  
the employer. The unit is either a flat dollar amount or (more often) a percentage of compensationusually 1 1/2 2 1/2%.  
Total years of service are multiplied by this percentage. For example, if total years of service is 30 and the percentage is  
1 1/2, 45% would be applied to either the career average earnings or final average earnings (highest three of five  
consecutive years of earnings). If the average of the highest five consecutive years of earnings is $100,000, the yearly  
retirement benefit would be $45,000. (b) Level Percentage of CompensationAfter a minimum number of years of  
service (usually 20) and a minimum age (usually 50), all employees will receive the same percentage of earnings as a  
retirement benefit, regardless of income, position in the company, or years of service. For example, each employee who  
is at least 50 years of age, with at least 20 years of service receives 20% of compensation. This plan is more common  
than the flat amount approach described below. (c) Flat AmountAfter having attained a minimum number of years of  
service (usually 20) and a minimum age (usually 50), all employees will receive the same absolute dollar amount as a  
retirement benefit, regardless of income, position in the company, or years of service. For example, each employee who  
is at least 50 years of age, with at least 20 years of service receives $8000 a year in retirement benefits.  
2. Variable Dollars: (a) Cost-of-Living Planbenefits are modified according to changes in a predetermined price  
indexusually, the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For example, when the CPI increases by at least 3% benefits are  
increased by that percentage. (b) Equity Annuity Planpremiums are paid into a variable annuity plan to purchase  
accumulation units. At retirement, the accumulation units are converted to retirement units whose values fluctuate  
according to the common stock portfolio in which the premiums were invested.

Page 129  
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN (MONEY PURCHASE PLAN) retirement plan under which  
contributions are fixed in advance by formula, and benefits vary. These plans are often used by organizations that must  
know what the cost of employee benefits will be in the years ahead. For example, nonprofit organizations such as  
charities need to project future pension expenses that will not rise above a preset limit. This enables budgets to be  
established that provide guidelines for their solicitation of funds.  
DEFINITE LOSS see REQUIREMENTS OF INSURABLE RISK.  
DEFINITIONS essential parts of insurance policies that explain the meanings of important words and phrases found in  
those policies.  
DEGREE OF CARE minimum of care owed by one party for the physical safety of another. Liability suits are brought  
because of negligent acts and omissions resulting from failures to exercise due care.  
DEGREE OF RISK amount of uncertainty in a given situation. Probability that actual experience will be different from  
what is expected.  
DELAY CLAUSE in CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE policies, provision that allows the insurance company to  
refuse the POLICYHOLDER a loan on the cash value for a period of time, usually up to 6 months, from the request  
date. The only exception is for premium payments due on the policy.  
DELAYED PAYMENT CLAUSE life insurance policy provision stating that after the death of an insured, the proceeds  
from a policy are not immediately paid to the primary beneficiary; instead, they are delayed for a specified time period.  
This usually occurs in common disaster situations.  
DELIVERY physical handing of an insurance policy to the insured. Sales training emphasizes the importance of  
delivery of a policy by the agent. This develops a caring attitude on the part of the agent and reinforces the insured's  
belief that he or she made the right decision in purchasing the policy.  
DELIVERY RECEIPT signed receipt by POLICYOWNER acknowledging that policyowner is in possession of the  
policy.  
DEMOLITION CLAUSE in PROPERTY INSURANCE policies, provision that excludes the insurance company's  
liability for indemnification of the insured for the insured's expenses incurred in the demolition of undamaged property.  
DEMOLITION INSURANCE coverage that will indemnify the insured for the expenses, up to the limits of the policy,  
if a building is damaged by a peril such as fire, and zoning requirements and/or building codes mandate that the building  
be demolished.

DEMURRAGE compensation payable to the owner of a ship detained for reasons beyond his or her control who incurs  
a loss of earnings because of the delay. Detainment can be caused by a delay in the loading or unloading of the ship.  
DEMUTUALIZATION (STOCKING A MUTUAL) conversion of form of ownership from a MUTUAL INSURANCE  
COMPANY to a STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY. Interest in demutualization of life insurance companies surged in  
the early 1980s among many large mutual companies because they felt they needed new sources of capital to compete in  
the financial services revolution.  
DENTAL EXPENSE INSURANCE insurance that usually follows the format of COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH  
INSURANCE plans in that there is a COINSURANCE requirement of usually 75 to 80%, and a limit on benefits for  
any one person per calendar year. In many instances, there is no deductible for annual preventive oral examinations.  
Orthodontia benefits are usually provided separately.  
DENTAL INSURANCE coverage for dental services under a group or individual policy.  
DEPARTMENT STORE INSURANCE FLOATER coverage for items of property being delivered to a customer. The  
means of transportation covered include such common carriers as aircraft, railroads, trucks, express carrier, and other  
variations, as well as the department store's trucks and other delivery vehicles. Coverage can be purchased on an ALL  
RISKS basis subject to excluded perils such as war and nuclear disaster. Coverage applies on a blanket basis meaning  
that all locations of points of delivery are covered.  
DEPENDENT a person who relies on another for economic support. For insurance purposes, the following may be  
included: (1) the insured's legal spouse; (2) any unmarried children younger than a specified age who are dependent  
upon the insured for support (age requirements vary from plan to plan); (3) unmarried children between specified years  
of age who are dependent upon the insured for support, and who are full-time students in an educational institution (age  
requirements vary).  
A dependent child cannot be covered under more than one insured employee's plan. For example, if the husband and  
wife are both insured employees of different companies, coordination of benefits would determine which plan is  
primary and which plan is secondary. In some states, the father's plan is primary; in other states, the birthday rule  
would be used: the parent with the earlier birthday would have the primary plan.

DEPENDENT CARE ACCOUNT type of FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT. See also FLEXIBLE SPENDING  
ACCOUNTHEALTH CARE/DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES.  
DEPENDENT CARE ASSISTANCE PLANS (DCAP) fringe benefit provided by the employer to its employees as  
sanctioned under the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act. Under Internal Revenue Code Section 129, this benefit is  
nontaxable to the employee and the costs incurred by the employer are considered tax deductible as a necessary  
business expense. The dependent under DCAP is defined as a dependent child under age 15, a dependent elderly  
relative, or a dependent mentally and/or physically handicapped individual. DCAP can be implemented through a salary  
reduction program under which the employee can choose to reduce his or her salary up to a maximum of $5000  
annually for dependent care-related expenses. A current EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN can be amended  
to include DCAP, thereby making the benefit available to all employees. DCAP permits the employee to select the type  
of dependent care program that he or she prefers.  
DEPENDENT CARE FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT account that is similar in form to the HEALTH PLAN  
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT (FSA) with contributions to this account used to reimburse employees who are  
parents for expenses at a children's day care center or home child care. Employees can also be reimbursed for expenses  
associated with caring for an elderly parent.  
DEPENDENT COVERAGE coverage under life and health insurance policies for dependents of a named insured to  
include a spouse and unmarried children under a specified age. Under some life insurance policies an insured's spouse  
and dependent children, unmarried and under age 21, can be added at favorable rates. Health insurance policies cover  
the same dependent individuals at a far cheaper rate than the cost of separate policies for them.  
DEPENDENT PROPERTIES BUSINESS INCOME FORM form that provides insurance coverage for the insured in  
the event the damage or destruction of non-owned property reduces or terminates the insured's earnings. For example, if  
the insured manufactures plastic airplane kits, and the supplier of the plastic for making the airplanes has a catastrophic  
fire at its plant, the manufacturer would not be able to continue to produce the kits in the necessary volume. Thus, the  
manufacturer would be indemnified by the insurance company for its lost earnings.  
DEPOSIT ADMINISTRATION GROUP ANNUITY see PENSION PLAN FUNDING: GROUP DEPOSIT

and are not currently allocated to the purchase of benefits for the employee. At retirement, an immediate retirement  
annuity is purchased for the employee. The amount of monthly income depends on the investment results of the funds  
left on deposit. Many insurance companies guarantee a minimum rate of return on funds left on deposit.  
DEPOSITORS FORGERY INSURANCE coverage provided for individuals or businesses for loss due to forgery or  
alteration of such financial instruments as notes, checks, drafts, and promissory notes.  
DEPOSIT PREMIUM premium required by an insurance company for plans subject to premium adjustment. The initial  
provisional premium is paid to put a commercial property or liability insurance policy into force. The final premium is  
determined at the end of the policy period, based on an insured's actual exposures and loss experience.  
DEPOSIT TERM LIFE INSURANCE policy in which a premium (the deposit) is paid in the first policy year, in  
addition to the regular term insurance premiums required. The deposit is left to accumulate at interest for a specific  
number of years, e.g., 10. Thereafter, the policy-owner can receive the deposit plus interest or may renew the policy  
without the INSURED having to furnish EVIDENCE OF INSURABILITY. This procedure can be repeated every 10  
years, in some instances up to age 100. A deposit term policy can be converted to ORDINARY LIFE, or  
DECREASING TERM LIFE INSURANCE without evidence of insurability. However, if the policyowner cancels the  
policy prior to the initial 10 years, the deposit and any interest is forfeited. If the insured dies before the policy is  
converted, the deposit plus the interest is added to the death benefit.  
DEPRECIATION actual or accounting recognition of the decrease in the value of a hard asset (property) over a period  
of time, according to a predetermined schedule such as straight line depreciation.  
DEPRECIATION INSURANCE see REPLACEMENT COST LESS PHYSICAL DEPRECIATION AND  
OBSOLESCENCE.  
DERIVATIVES securities that derive their value from other financial instruments that are used by the insurance  
company to hedge its bets on which direction the market is moving. For example, cattle futures are a simple derivative  
in that the cattle futures contract increases or decreases in value as future prices change for cows on the hoof. When  
insurance companies use derivatives, they are more likely to use them in association with currency and interest rate  
transactions as a means of protecting themselves against adverse moves in interest rates or foreign currency exchanges.  
This instrument provides a mechanism for hedging against the interest rate risks that are inherent within insurance  
products by pricing in that risk in advance and protecting against future negative occurrences.

DEVIATED RATE rates used by a property and casualty insurance company that are different from that suggested by a  
RATING BUREAU. An insurance company may use deviated rates because it feels they are more indicative of the  
company's experience.  
DEVIATING INSURANCE COMPANY insurance company whose premium rates are usually below that of other  
insurance companies and the RATING BUREAU.  
DEVIATION see DEVIATED RATE.  
DEVIATION POLICY INSURANCE POLICY that differs from the STANDARD FORM.  
DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUP method of determining reimbursement from medical insurance according to  
diagnosis on a prospective basis. It originated with the MEDICARE program.  
DIC see DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS INSURANCE.  
DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS INSURANCE coverage for a physical structure, machinery, inventory, and  
merchandise within the structure in the event of earthquakes, flood collapses, and subsidence strikes. Even though  
coverage is on an ALL RISKS basis, important perils are excluded such as fire, vandalism, sprinkler leakage, employee  
dishonesty, boiler and machinery losses, and mysterious disappearance, since it is assumed that the insured business  
already has coverage for these perils under a business property insurance policy.  
DIP-DOWN CLAUSE provision in an UMBRELLA LIABILITY INSURANCE policy under which the policy will pay  
those losses that come within the retention limits of the primary policy, but the primary policy cannot pay because its  
aggregate limits have no further capacity.  
DIRECT COVER AUTOMATIC NONPROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE treaty or AUTOMATIC  
PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE treaty that provides coverage for losses upon which claims are made while the  
treaty is in force, without regard to when these losses actually occurred. See also CLAIMS MADE BASIS LIABILITY  
COVERAGE; CLAIMS OCCURRENCE BASIS LIABILITY COVERAGE.  
DIRECT LIABILITY legal obligation of an individual or business because of negligent acts or omissions resulting in  
bodily injury and/or property damage or destruction to another party. There are no intervening circumstances.  
DIRECT LOSS property loss in which the insured peril is the proximate cause (an unbroken chain of events) of the  
damage or destruction. Most basic property insurance policies (such as the standard fire policy) insure against only  
direct loss and not INDIRECT LOSS or CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS. For example, a fire within the wall structure of a  
house causes the drapes to catch fire, which in turn fans flames onto the  
< previous page page_133 next page >  
 
< previous page page_134 next page >  
Page 134  
furniturea direct loss. An indirect loss would be inconvenience of the inhabitants, who would not be able to sleep in  
their home, thus causing a drop in their efficiency at work.  
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage when a director or officer of a company commits  
a negligent act or omission, or misstatement or misleading statement, and a successful libel suit is brought against the  
company as a result. Usually a large deductible is required. The policy provides coverage for directors' and officers'  
liability exposure if they are sued as individuals. Coverage is also provided for the costs of defense such as legal fees  
and other court costs.  
DIRECT PLACEMENT security sold by the issuer of the security directly to the purchasing financial institution  
without the inclusion of the investment banker in this process. Insurance companies are frequent purchasers of securities  
in this way. Only the largest firms with the highest credit ratings are able to issue these types of securities. The issuer  
avoids the uncertainty of the market through these private negotiations.  
DIRECT PROPERTY EXPOSURES circumstance in which there is a PROBABILITY loss to PERSONAL  
PROPERTY or REAL PROPERTY resulting from property damage, destruction, or disappearance. See also  
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FLOATER; COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FORM; HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE  
POLICY; PERSONAL ARTICLES INSURANCE; PERSONAL EFFECTS INSURANCE; PERSONAL PROPERTY  
FLOATER; COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY (CPP).  
DIRECT RECOGNITION immediate taking-into-account of present interest rates, mortality experience, and expenses  
in premiums currently charged. This is critical to the formulation of CURRENT ASSUMPTION WHOLE LIFE  
INSURANCE products. See also UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE.  
DIRECT REGISTRATION SYSTEM system in which shareholders are not issued physical stock certificates; instead,  
they are sent a statement that shows the number of shares registered in the shareholder's name on the insurance  
company's books (on direct deposit with the company).  
DIRECT RESPONSE MARKETING (DIRECT SELLING SYSTEM) method of selling insurance directly to insureds  
through a company's own employees, through the mail, or at airport booths. The company uses this method of  
distribution rather than independent or captive agents for effectiveness and efficiency.  
DIRECT ROLLOVER ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION that is paid directly from an employee's  
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN to the employee's INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) or  
to another plan maintained by the employer that accepts rollovers. Under such a  
< previous page page_134 next page >  
 
< previous page page_135 next page >  
Page 135  
rollover, the employee is not taxed on any part of the distribution until it is withdrawn from the IRA or the employermaintained  
plan. The employee can open an IRA to receive the distribution. If an employee is employed by a new  
employer who maintains an employee benefit insurance plan that accepts rollovers, the distribution can be placed  
directly into that plan. If the new employer does not accept rollovers, the employee can place the distribution into an  
IRA.

DIRECT WRITER  
1. property insurer that distributes its products through a direct selling system. Traditionally, insurers often were known  
as direct writ-ers if they used either a direct selling system or an exclusive agency system for distribution. Increasingly,  
the term applies only to those using a direct selling system.  
2. reinsurer that deals directly with a CEDING COMPANY, without using a REINSURANCE BROKER.  
DIRECT WRITING AGENT see CAPTIVE AGENT.  
DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUM total premiums received by a PROPERTY AND LIABILITY insurance company  
without any adjustments for the ceding of any portion of these premiums to the REINSURER.  
DISABILITY physiological or psychological condition that prevents an insured from performing normal job functions.  
DISABILITY BENEFIT income paid under a disability policy that is not covered under WORKERS  
COMPENSATION BENEFITS. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the insured's income prior to the disability,  
but there may be a limit on the amount and duration of benefits. The most advantageous policy pays a monthly  
disability income benefit for as long as the insured is unable to perform suitable job functions determined by experience,  
education, and training.  
DISABILITY BENEFIT, COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE see DISABILITY BENEFIT.  
DISABILITY BUY-OUT INSURANCE buy-sell agreements found in partnerships, sole proprietorships, and close  
corporations. Either the business entity or the surviving members of the business agree to buy out the interest of a  
disabled member according to a predetermined formula funded through insurance. Disability buy-out insurance can be  
more important to a business than death buy-out insurance because the chances of becoming disabled are 7 to 10 times  
greater than death, depending on the age of the individual. The mechanisms available for the disability buy-out are the  
same as those found under BUSINESS LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE. See also PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND  
HEALTH INSURANCE.

DISABILITY CLAUSE PROVISION found in a LIFE INSURANCE POLICY that provides that certain benefits will  
be paid in the event the insured becomes totally and permanently disabled from an accident incurred or sickness  
contacted. See also WAIVER OF PREMIUM (WP).  
DISABILITY INCOME (DI) life insurance payment issued after the insured has been disabled for at least six months.  
One percent of the face value of the policy is paid the insured as a monthly income benefit and premiums are waived for  
the duration of the disability. A DISABILITY INCOME RIDER can be attached to an ordinary life insurance policy to  
provide this disability income benefit at extra charge. The insured can have a WAVIER OF PREMIUM benefit without  
a disability income benefit, but cannot have the disability income benefit without the waiver of premiums benefit.  
DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE health insurance that provides income payments to the insured wage earner  
when income is interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or accident. Definitions under this insurance  
include:  
1. Total and Partial Disabilityreduction in benefits if the insured is found to be partially disabled instead of totally  
disabled.  
2. Amount of Benefitsmany policies stipulate that all sources of disability income cannot exceed 50% to 80% of the  
insured's earnings prior to the disability, subject to a maximum absolute dollar amount.  
3. Duration of Benefitslength of time benefits will be paid. Some policies will pay benefits for one or two years,  
whereupon the insured must agree to be retrained for other work. Other policies pay benefits as long as the insured is  
unable to do the job for which he or she is suited by training, education, and experience (often up to age 65, when  
retirement programs take over). Some policies pay lifetime benefits.  
4. ELIMINATION PERIOD (Waiting Period)period beginning with the first day of disability, during which no  
payments are made to the insured. The longer this period, the lower the premiums.  
5. Physician's Carethe insured must be regularly attended by a legally qualified physician because it is necessary to  
assess changes in severity of disability.  
6. PREEXISTING CONDITIONif an insured has a preexisting injury, sickness, or illness, most policies will not pay  
income benefits either for the duration of the policy or until a period of time (usu-ally from six months to one year) has  
elapsed.  
7. Recurrent Disabilitymost policies will not pay income benefits to an insured who is experiencing a recurrent  
disability unless the recurrent disability is deemed a new disability. Some more progressive policies define a recurrent  
disability as a new disability if there has been a break of at least six months between the first disability and the current  
disability, and the insured has returned to work during that break.

Page 137  
8. RESIDUAL DISABILITYmany policies pay for the unused portion of the total disability period, limited to age 65.  
DISABILITY INCOME RECORD SYSTEM (DIRS) service under the auspices of the MEDICAL INFORMATION  
BUREAU (MIB) that provides the insurance company with nonmedical information concerning the APPLICANT for  
DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE. The purpose of this system is to warn the insurance company in the event the  
applicant tries to purchase excessive amounts of disability income insurance from various companies. The member  
insurance company is required to report to the DIRS an applicant for disability income insurance in amounts of at least  
$300 per month to be paid to the disabled insured for at least 12 months. The DIRS then stores this information in its  
computer files, from which it is retrievable by any member company.  
DISABILITY INCOME RIDER addition to a life insurance policy stating that when an insured becomes disabled for at  
least six months, premiums due are waived. Depending on the rider, the insured may begin to receive a monthly income  
(usually 1% of the face value of the policy), or only the premium may be waived. The length of time that income  
payments will continue depends on the definition of disability in the policy. During the time that premiums are waived,  
the life insurance policy stays in force, so that if the insured dies, the beneficiary receives the face value of the policy.  
Cash values continue to build, and if the policy is participating, dividends continue to be paid. See also DISABILITY

DISAPPEARING DEDUCTIBLE in property insurance, amount that an insured does not have to pay when a loss  
exceeds a predetermined sum; here the insurance company pays more than 100% of the loss, so that the deductible  
amount specified in a contract ''vanishes." For example, if a deductible amount is $100, an insurance company may pay  
125% of the losses exceeding $100, 150% of the losses exceeding $200, and if the losses exceed $300, the company  
pays the total amount of the loss (so that the insured does not assume any deductible for losses over $300). In another  
application an insured pays 125% of all losses over $100, the deductible disappears for any loss of $500 or more. See  
also DEDUCTIBLE.  
DISASTER CLAUSE see COMMON DISASTER CLAUSE (SURVIVORSHIP CLAUSE).

terminates is usually limited to one year.  
DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY legal power of the commissioner of Internal Revenue to approve any classification  
of employees that does not discriminate in favor of a prohibited group. Such approval is necessary before a retirement  
plan can be a qualified pension plan and thus subject to tax benefits.  
DISCRIMINATION failure of an insurance company to offer similar insurance coverages at comparable premium rates  
to all individuals or groups with the same UNDERWRITING characteristics. Such discriminatory practices are  
prohibited by state and federal law.  
DISEASE illness or sickness such as cancer, poliomyelitis, leukemia, diphtheria, smallpox, scarlet fever, tetanus, spinal  
meningitis, encephalitis, tularemia, hydrophobia, and sickle cell anemia, all of which are covered in health insurance  
policies as specified.  
DISINTERMEDIATION flow of funds out of one financial instrument, whose interest rates are low, into another  
financial instrument, whose interest rates are higher. In the early 1980s, insurance companies experienced  
disintermediation as whole life policies were surrendered for their cash values and these sums were then transferred to  
higher interest-paying noninsurance products. Because of this situation, INTEREST SENSITIVE POLICIES were  
developed by INSURANCE COMPANIES.  
DISMEMBERMENT BENEFIT income paid under health insurance for loss of use of various parts of the body due to  
an accident. A schedule of benefits available in a policy lists payments for each part of the body that is dismembered.  
DISMEMBERMENT INSURANCE see ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT INSURANCE.  
DISQUALIFIED PERSON individual prohibited under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT  
OF 1974 (ERISA) from conducting transactions with a trust plan. The prohibition is intended to prevent a conflict of  
interest between the prohibited person with a vested interest in the trust plan and the trust plan itself. Prohibited  
individuals include employer, trust plan participant, trustee of the plan, and fiduciary of the trust plan.

DIVIDED COVER insurance coverage purchased on the same item from two or more insurance companies.  
DIVIDEND sum returned to a policyowner by an insurance company under a participating policy. Dividends are not  
deemed as taxable distributions, as the Internal Revenue Service interprets them as a refund of a portion of the premium  
paid. There are several ways in which the policyowner may use dividends. See also DIVIDEND OPTION.  
DIVIDEND ACCUMULATION option under a participating life insurance policy in which dividends are left on  
deposit with the company to accumulate at a specified interest rate. If this option is chosen, it is important to determine  
the interest rate. Interest on dividends left on deposit is taxable.  
DIVIDEND ADDITION option in a participating policy under which dividends are used to purchase fully paid-up units  
of whole life insurance. This option deserves careful consideration by young families since it allows the purchase of  
extra life insurance without having to take a physical examination. Paid-up additions generate dividends and cash values  
that in turn will generate additional dividends and cash values.  
DIVIDEND ILLUSTRATION picture of future DIVIDENDS that the insurance company expects to be allocated to a  
specific BLOCK OF POLICIES. The accuracy of this picture depends on the actual future mortality, investment, and  
expense experience being the same as that of the projected dividends. One way to judge the validity of the projected  
dividends is to ascertain the dividends that the company has actually paid out in the past and the dividends that it is  
currently paying out. Although this is not a guarantee of future payments, it can be a strong indication of future payouts.  
DIVIDEND OPTION methods of handling policyholder dividends. In a participating life insurance policy, dividends  
are paid to the policyowner according to which of the following options is selected: (1)

applied to reduce premiums; (2) paid in cash; (3) purchase increments of paid-up life insurance; (4) left on deposit with  
the insurance company to accumulate at interest; or (5) purchase extended term life insurance for one year in the amount  
a dividend can buy (Fifth Dividend Option). Some health and property insurance policies have dividend options.

DOCTRINE OF LAST CLEAR CHANCE see LAST CLEAR CHANCE.  
DOLLAR COST AVERAGING strategy of regularly investing a fixed amount of dollars into a VARIABLE DOLLAR  
ANNUITY over a substantial period of time regardless of the ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUE. The investment will  
be made when the unit value is low, high, or moderate, permitting the average cost per unit to be significantly below the  
high point in the market. Thus, the investor will not be confronted with "Buying High" and "Selling Low."  
DOMESTIC INSURER insurance company incorporated according to the laws of the state in which a risk is located  
and the policy issued. The insurance company is domiciled in that state.  
DOMICILE state in which an insurance company has its principal legal residence; where an individual resides in a fixed  
permanent home.  
DOMINO THEORY OF ACCIDENT CAUSATION theory developed in 1931 by H. W. Heinrich; states that an  
accident is only one of a series of factors, each of which depends on a previous factor in the following manner:  
1. accident causes an injury.  
2. individual's negligent act or omission, or a faulty machine, causes an accident.  
3. personal shortcomings cause negligent acts or omissions.  
4. hereditary and environment cause personal shortcomings. See also HEINRICH, H. W.

DOUBLE INDEMNITY see ACCIDENTAL DEATH CLAUSE.  
DOUBLE-PROTECTION POLICY life insurance contract that combines TERM LIFE INSURANCE with WHOLE  
LIFE INSURANCE. The term portion of the contract expires after a stipulated time period. If the insured dies during  
this stipulated period, both the term portion and the whole life portion of the contract will pay. If the insured dies after  
the stipulated time period, only the whole life portion of the contract will pay.  
DOUBLE RECOVERY payments in excess of the value of the lossa prohibited practice. When an insured has more  
than one policy covering a risk, the full value cannot be collected from each policy if a loss occurs. The most that can be  
collected is each policy's pro rata share of the loss. For example, a home is insured under two policies of $100,000 each.  
If there is a fire loss of $100,000, the most that can be collected from each policy is $50,000.  
DOWER INTEREST wife's interest in her husband's property upon his death. The wife has an insurable interest in that

responsible for bodily injury and/or property damage caused by its customers to a third party. Insurance coverage is  
available, but at a high premium rate. See also DRAM SHOP LIABILITY INSURANCE; LIQUOR LIABILITY  
LAWS.  
DRAM SHOP LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for dispensers of alcoholic beverages against suits arising out of  
bodily injury and/or property damage caused by its customers to a third party. Establishments covered include bars,  
restaurants, hotels, motels, or wherever the alcoholic beverages are dispensed. These establishments are excluded from  
coverage under GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
DREAD DISEASE INSURANCE health insurance coverage only for a specified catastrophic disease such as cancer. It  
is important to ascertain the waiting period required, maximum benefits and maximum length of time they are payable,  
and the exact definition of the disease covered. Individual and group health insurance usually cover all diseases,  
including dread diseases.  
DRIVE OTHER CAR INSURANCE (DOC) endorsement to an automobile insurance policy that protects an insured in  
either or both of two circumstances when driving a nonowned car:  
1. business endorsementif the insured's negligent acts or omissions result in bodily injury or property damage to a third  
party while the insured is driving a nonowned car for business activities.

DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE ACT OF 1988 federal statute relating to drug abuse policies that requires all employers  
with federal contracts at least equal to $25,000 to certify, as a condition of receiving a federal contract, that the  
employer will provide and maintain a drug-free workplace. In addition, a recipient of a federal grant (award of financial  
assistance that includes block grant and entitlement grant programs), as well as an independent contractor, must certify  
that the employer will provide and maintain a drug-free workplace. This act also requires federal contractors and  
grantees to publish and distribute a policy statement stating the prohibitions against the unlawful manufacture,  
distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of controlled substances in the workplace. An ongoing drug-free awareness  
program must be established warning employees of the dangers of drug abuse.  
DRUGGISTS LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage in the event that, while practicing the profession of druggist, an act  
or omission is committed resulting in bodily injury, personal injury, and/or property damage to a customer. Also  
covered is liability arising through the use of products on or off of the business's premises. For example, a child is born  
after a druggist negligently places sugar tablets instead of birth control pills in a container for a customer. The druggist  
may have to provide funds necessary to sustain the child until the age of majority.  
DUAL CAPACITY DOCTRINE rule of law under which a defendant who has two or more relationships with a  
plaintiff may be liable under any of these relationships. For example, an employer may be liable in two ways to an  
employee who incurs bodily injury on the job as the result of using a product or service produced by that employer:  
first, as the employer of the injured employee, and second, as the producer of the product or service that caused injury to  
the employee. The injured employee may then either collect benefits for job-related  
< previous page page_143 next page >  
 
< previous page page_144 next page >  
Page 144  
injuries under workers compensation or sue the employer as the producer of the defective product or service. For  
example, if an employee injures an arm at work while operating a machine with a defective blade that the employer  
manufactures, the employee can receive benefits under workers compensation or sue the employer as the manufacturer  
of the defective blade.  
DUAL LIFE STOCK COMPANY stock life insurance company that sells PARTICIPATING INSURANCE and  
NONPARTICIPATING INSURANCE.  
DUE CARE/DUE DILIGENCE assurance by the agent that the recommended insurance plan for the client is suitable  
for that client's specific needs. This assurance is derived from a careful analysis by the agent of the insurance company's  
financial strength, the accuracy of the policy illustrations, and the treatment of its previous and current policyowners.

When interest rates rise, the average maturity and duration of the bond portfolio is lengthened, resulting in the portfolio  
becoming more aggressively positioned to take advantage of the falling bond prices. Conversely, when interest rates  
fall, the average maturity and duration of the bond portfolio is shortened, resulting in the portfolio becoming more  
defensively positioned to take advantage of the rising bond prices.

1. Basic/Regular/General FormCoverage for property damage to a building used as a dwelling, as well as its contents.  
(Contents coverage is not restricted to the building or dwelling; coverage can be applied to contents of buildings such as  
hotels, that do not qualify as dwellings under the DB&C). The property coverage for the building includes items  
attached to the building such as equipment and fixtures, built-ins, furnace, air conditioner, hot water heater, and lighting  
fixtures. An optional extension of the dwelling coverage of up to 10% can be applied to private structures on the  
premises such as a garage. Contents coverage on household and personal goods within the dwelling can be extended to  
off-premises household and personal contents for up to 10%. Perils insured for both dwelling and contents are fire,  
lightning, and removal of the property from the premises to further protect it from damage from the perils. For an  
additional charge, vandalism and malicious mischief can also be insured against.  
2. Broad FormIncludes the basic coverages plus the additional perils of burglary; falling objects; weight of snow and/or  
ice; accidental discharge, leakage, or overflow of water or steam from an air conditioning, heating, and/or plumbing  
mechanism and/or household appliance; glass breakage; damage resulting from water or freezing of plumbing and/or  
heating mechanisms; and structural problems leading to the collapse of the building. Damage from insured perils  
resulting in additional living expenses is also provided.  
3. Special FormCoverage on an ALL RISKS basis for only the structure of a dwelling, with no coverage for its contents.  
DWELLING COVERAGE see DWELLING, BUILDINGS, AND CONTENTS INSURANCE (DB&C).  
DWELLING FORM see DWELLING, BUILDINGS, AND CONTENTS INSURANCE (DB&C).  
DWELLING INSURANCE POLICY PROGRAM coverage for a dwelling's structure; appurtenant structures on the  
premises; personal contents and household items within the dwelling; and 10% of the coverage applicable to such  
personal contents and household items away from the premises, for example at a hotel. Additional living expenses are  
covered because of the damage of an insured peril to the dwelling and/or its contents, and loss of rental value of the  
dwelling and/or its contents.

EARLY DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SECTION 401(a), 403(a), 403(b) RETIREMENT PLAN plan in which funds are  
withdrawn or income begins before the plan participant reaches age 59 1/2. An extra 10% early distribution tax on the  
taxable amount may have to be paid unless any one of the following conditions exist: (1) distribution because the  
participant is disabled; (2) participant is separated from job after the attainment of at least age 55 and the distribution is  
received at that time; (3) participant terminates job and begins to receive annuity income consisting of a series of  
substantially equal payments at regular intervals (at least on an annual basis) over the lifetime, or life expectancy, or  
joint life expectancies of the participant and the participant's beneficiary; and (4) participant incurs medical expenses of  
at least 7 1/2% of adjusted gross income. If the participant dies before reaching age 59 1/2, the beneficiary(s) will not be  
subject to the payment of the 10% early distribution tax.  
The availability of cash withdrawals and annuity income based on funds contributed as well as earnings on those funds  
under salary reduction plans beginning January 1, 1989 is restricted by the Internal Revenue Code. Such withdrawals  
and receipt of income can only be made if the plan participant is at least age 59 1/2, terminates employment, becomes  
disabled, or dies.  
EARLY RETIREMENT term in pensions; leaving a job before normal retirement age, subject to minimum  
requirements of age and years of service. There usually is a reduction in the monthly retirement benefit.  
EARNED PREMIUM portion of a premium paid by an insured that has been allocated to the insurance company's loss  
experience, expenses, and profit year to date.  
EARNED RIGHT basic feature of the SOCIAL SECURITY ACT under which benefits paid are associated with the  
employee's earnings that have been taxed during the employment period.  
EARNED SURPLUS see RETAINED EARNINGS.  
EARNINGS INSURANCE see GROSS EARNINGS FORM.  
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE coverage that can be purchased as an endorsement to many property policies such as  
the Standard Fire Policy or as a separate policy. Coverage is for direct damage resulting from earthquake or volcanic  
eruption. If there is a lapse of at least 72 hours between earthquake shocks, then each loss by a given earthquake is  
subject to a new claim. Excluded are losses resulting from fire, explosion, flood, or tidal wave.

EASEMENT right of one party to use land owned by another party. For example, an electric utility can obtain an  
easement through court action to place its power lines across someone's property, even if the owner is unwilling to give  
permission.  
ECONOMIC BENEFIT see SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE.  
ECONOMIC LOSS total estimated cost incurred by a person or persons, a family, or a business resulting from the death  
or disability of a wage earner (KEY EMPLOYEE), damage or destruction of property, and/or a liability suit (negligent  
acts or omissions by a person result in property damage or bodily injury to a THIRD PARTY). Factors included in the  
total cost are loss of earnings, medical expenses, funeral expenses, property damage restoration expenses, and legal  
expenses. See also ECONOMIC OR USE VALUE; HUMAN LIFE VALUE APPROACH (ECONOMIC VALUE OF  
AN INDIVIDUAL LIFE) (EVOIL); SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE.  
ECONOMIC OR USE VALUE property valued according to its earnings potential. However, property insurance  
contracts generally indemnify an insured on a REPLACEMENT COST LESS PHYSICAL DEPRECIATION AND  
OBSOLESCENCE BASIS.  
ECONOMIC VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIFE (EVOIL) see HUMAN LIFE VALUE APPROACH.  
EDUCATIONAL FUND factor considered in determining amount of life insurance to purchase in order that funds will  
be available to pay for a child's education expenses in the event of the premature death of the wage earner. See also

EITF 93-6 rule adopted by the FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD that requires that obligations  
owed to REINSURERS under multiyear insurance contracts must be reported as liabilities by the CEDING  
COMPANIES and as assets by the reinsurers. Conversely, if the ceding companies make a profit under the contract, it  
must report the profit as an asset and the reinsurers must report the profit as a liability.  
ELECTRICAL (ELECTRICAL APPARATUS) EXEMPTION CLAUSE common element in property insurance that  
excludes electrical damage or destruction of an appliance unless the damage is caused by a resultant fire.

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI) method used to reduce WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE  
costs by using a single database system to electronically link claims administration, medical claim costs, RISK  
MANAGEMENT, and vendor services. EDI can reduce errors in claims handling thereby making the process more  
efficient. Also, EDI permits the comprehensive gathering of demographic claims data pinpointing the factors that affect  
the risk.  
ELEMENTS OF AN INSURANCE CONTRACT see ANALYSIS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICY;  
INSURANCE CONTRACT, GENERAL; INSURANCE CONTRACT, HEALTH; INSURANCE CONTRACT, LIFE;  
INSURANCE CONTRACT, PROPERTY AND CASUALTY.  
ELEVATOR COLLISION INSURANCE liability coverage for damage or destruction of a structure, elevator, and/or  
personal property due to the collision of an elevator.  
ELEVATOR LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for suits brought by a plaintiff as the result of bodily injury incurred  
while using an elevator on the insured's premises.  
ELIGIBLE EXPENSES see GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE.  
ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN plan under which an employee may make a ROLLOVER contribution. If that  
contribution is from a QUALIFIED TRUST, the employee may make rollover contributions to an employer's qualified  
trust, INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA), or an ANNUITY.  
ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS payments from an employee's EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE  
PLAN that can be rolled over to an INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) or to another plan maintained by  
the employer that accepts rollovers.  
ELIGIBILITY PERIOD length of time in life and health insurance in which an employee can apply for and pay the first  
premium without having to show evidence of insurability (take a physical examination). The period is usually the first  
30 days of employment. After expiration of the eligibility period, an employee may have to take a physical or provide  
medical history information to qualify for coverage. If the employee does not pass the physical, coverage can be denied  
under a group plan or the employee can be charged a much higher premium rate than the group rate. This is why it is  
extremely important for a new employee to apply for group life and health insurance during the eligibility period.  
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS conditions found in employee benefit plans such as pensions, under which minimum  
requirements, such as 20 years of service, must be met by an employee to qualify for benefits.

ELIMINATION PERIOD form of deductible usually found in disability income insurance; for example, no benefits  
may be payable for a length of time beginning with the first day of illness. Subsequently, benefits are usually paid only  
for costs incurred after the end of the elimination period. The longer the elimination period in a policy, the lower the  
premium.  
EMBEZZLEMENT theft of another's property by a person entrusted with that property. Coverage can be found under  
various bonding arrangements. See also FIDELITY BOND.  
EMERGENCY EXPOSURE LIMIT (EEL) maximum amount of a toxic agent to which an individual can be exposed  
for a very brief (emergency) period of time and still maintain physical safety. See also THRESHOLD LEVEL.  
EMERGENCY FUND factor considered in determining amount of life insurance to purchase in order that funds will be  
available to pay the emergency expenses following the death of a family member. See also NEEDS APPROACH.  
EMPIRICAL CONSIDERATION LOADING to the BURNING COST RATIO for a reinsurer's expenses, profit, and to  
build a reserve to meet unusually large claims.  
EMPIRICAL PROBABILITY mathematical relationship resulting from experimentation. For example, the  
PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION for the possible number of heads from four tosses of a fair coin having both a head  
and a tail can be calculated from experimentation and observation by allowing for the accumulation of empirical data.  
EMPIRICAL RATE CALCULATION adjustment of the BURNING COST RATIO for the increase in number and size  
of losses (losses likely in excess of that used in the unadjusted burning cost rate), INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED  
LOSSES (IBNR), inflation, expenses, profits, and contingencies.  
EMPLOYEE AS AN INSURED see BUSINESS LIABILITY INSURANCE; BUSINESSOWNERS POLICY (BOP).  
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS (EAPs) programs that deal with troublesome personal and family problems  
such as alcohol and drug abuse, marital problems, workplace violence, compulsive gambling, child care, legal problems,  
and care of elderly relatives.  
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN provision by an employer for the economic and social welfare of  
employees. Generally include: (1) pension plans for retirement; (2) group life insurance for death; (3) group health  
insurance for illness and accident; (4) group disability income insurance for loss of income due to illness and accident;  
and (5) accidental death and dismemberment. Dental insurance, eyeglass insurance, and legal expense insurance

may be included. These plans are established for the reasons of morale, to reduce turnover, and for tax benefits  
(contributions are usually deductible as business expenses to employers and not currently taxable income to employees).  
EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS workers' premiums in a contributory employee benefit plan.  
EMPLOYEE DEATH BENEFITS see EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN.  
EMPLOYEE DISHONESTY see FIDELITY BOND.  
EMPLOYEE FRIENDLY BENEFITS employee benefit plan that provides such benefits as long-term care insurance,  
dependent care spending amounts, sabbaticals, and parental leave.  
EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS see EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN.  
EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) law that established rules and regulations  
to govern private pension plans, including vesting requirements, funding mechanisms, and general plan design and  
descriptions. For example, three ways of vesting were established: full vesting after 10 years of service (Cliff Vesting);  
FIVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR RULE (at least 25% of benefits vest at end of 5 years of service, 5% each year during the  
next 5 years, and 10% each year during the next 5 years); and Rule of 45 (when employee's age and years of service add  
up to 45), 50% of the benefits must be vested with 10% additional vesting each year thereafter.  
Under the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986, vesting requirements were changed to 100% vesting after 5 years of service  
or 20% vesting after 3 years of service, 40% at the end of 4 years of service, 60% at the end of 5 years of service, 80%  
at the end of 6 years of service and 100% at the end of 7 years of service. (These vesting requirements are effective as of  
January 1, 1989.)  
EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) BOND federal law requiring that all  
PENSION PLAN trustees and anyone else who handles pension funds must obtain a FIDELITY BOND. This bond  
covers the plan in the event of embezzlement and theft. It is important to note that this bond does not provide coverage  
in the event poor investment choices result in losses. The insurance company as well as the amount of the bond must be  
stated in FORM 5500 filed annually with the Internal Revenue Service. The amount of the bond must be at least 10% of  
the pension plan's assets or $1000, whichever is the greatest amount.  
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) TRUST type of benefit in which an employee obtains shares of  
stock in the company, the amount normally determined by the employee's level of compensation. ESOP acts as a  
leverage tool through which the business is able  
< previous page page_151 next page >  
 
< previous page page_152 next page >  
Page 152  
to obtain a source of capital. The procedure is for a lender (usually a bank) to lend money to the ESOP. The ESOP then  
takes the borrowed money to buy stock from the company's treasury. In the meantime, the ESOP has signed a note with  
the lender for the borrowed funds with the stock pledged as collateral for the loan, and the business has guaranteed  
repayment if the ESOP fails to do so. The stock held in the ESOP is allocated to each employee as the business pays its  
contributions into the ESOP. The ESOP uses the company's contributions to repay the loan and the interest thereon. The  
contributions per employee that the company makes into the ESOP are tax deductible, and they are not taxable to the  
employee until the benefits are received.  
EMPLOYER CREDITS in a pension plan that an employer is required to make against future contributions (other than  
a cash basis as required by the IRS). Such credits may arise when an employee leaves an employer prior to being fully  
vested, works beyond normal retirement age.  
EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT ESCROWING OF ASSETS LIABILITY see EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT NET  
WORTH LIABILITY DETERMINATION.  
EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT INSURANCE COVERAGE LIABILITY coverage mandated by the EMPLOYEE  
RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) under which employers are required to purchase  
insurance to cover their contingent liability for unfunded employee pension benefits in the event a pension plan is  
terminated. This requirement is enforced by the PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC).  
EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT LIABILITY see EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT INSURANCE COVERAGE  
LIABILITY; EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT LIEN AGAINST ASSETS LIABILITY.  
EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT LIEN AGAINST ASSETS LIABILITY claim (lien) of the PENSION BENEFIT  
GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC) against an employer's assets upon termination of a pension plan for the  
amount of an employee's unfunded benefits.  
EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT NET WORTH LIABILITY DETERMINATION requirement upon termination of a  
pension plan; an employer must reimburse the PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC) for any  
loss that the PBGC incurs as the result of paying employee benefits that were the responsibility of the employer. The  
law requires reimbursement of up to 30% of the plan's net worth without regard to any contingent liability. This net  
worth is increased by escrowing or transferring any assets by the employer in contemplation of the plan's termination.

EMPLOYERS LEGAL OBLIGATION TO FUND pension plan format. After deciding how much to contribute, the  
employer can suspend, reduce, or discontinue contributions during the first 10 years only for reasons of business  
necessity; otherwise the employer will face a substantial IRS tax penalty. If a plan is terminated or if contributions to the  
plan are discontinued, the employer is only liable for benefit payments for which contributions were previously made.  
EMPLOYERS LIABILITY COVERAGE see WORKERS COMPENSATION, COVERAGE B.  
EMPLOYERS NET WORTH see EMPLOYERS CONTINGENT NET WORTH LIABILITY DETERMINATION.  
EMPLOYERS NONOWNERSHIP LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for the employer in the event of a TORT  
committed by an employee in the use of his or her own car while conducting business on behalf of the employer.  
EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX measurement of the changes in labor costs for money wages and salaries and noncash  
fringe benefits in nonfarm private industry and state and local governments for employees. The statistics are provided  
on a quarterly basis by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.  
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY COVERAGE plan that provides protection in the event of legal actions  
resulting from charges of harassment, discrimination, wrongful termination of employment, defamation, and invasion of  
privacy.  
ENCUMBRANCE claim, such as a worker's lien, to property under the care, custody, and control of another. This  
situation occurs when a worker is not paid for labor provided. For example, a carpenter unable to collect payment for  
installing wood finishings seeks an encumbrance on the owner's property.  
ENDORSEMENT written agreement attached to a policy to add or subtract insurance coverages. Once attached, the  
endorsement takes precedence over the original provisions of the policy. For example, under a homeowners policy an  
inflation guard endorsement is used so that property damage limits are increased automatically to reflect an increase in  
the cost of construction in the community. Vandalism and malicious mischief can be added to the Standard Fire Policy  
through an endorsement.  
ENDOWMENT ANNUITY INSURANCE INSURANCE POLICY that combines the elements of a DEFERRED  
ANNUITY with the elements of  
< previous page page_153 next page >  
 
< previous page page_154 next page >  
Page 154  
DECREASING TERM LIFE INSURANCE. This policy was originally designed to act as a funding instrument for  
PENSION PLANS but is rarely used today.  
ENDOWMENT INSURANCE life insurance under which an insured receives the face value of a policy if the  
individual survives the endowment period. If the insured does not survive, a beneficiary receives the face value of the  
policy. An endowment policy is the most expensive type of life insurance.  
ENERGY-RELEASE THEORY (OF ACCIDENT CAUSATION) method, developed in 1970 by Dr. William Haddon,  
Jr., of classifying and preventing damage caused by accidents. The thesis is that accidents are caused by the transfer of  
energy with such force that bodily injury and property damage result. According to Dr. Haddon, strategies can interrupt  
or suppress the chain of accident-causing events. These strategies revolve around (1) control and prevention of buildup  
of energy that is inherently injurious; (2) creation of an environment that is not conducive to injurious buildup of  
energy; and (3) production of counteractive measures to injurious buildup of energy.  
ENGINEERING APPROACH approach in loss prevention placing emphasis on physical features of the workplace as a  
potential cause of injuries. For example, if a product is inherently dangerous in design or during manufacture, an  
insurance company may assign an engineer to analyze the situation and recommend changes that could improve safety  
and lower insurance premiums.  
ENHANCED ORDINARY LIFE modified PARTICIPATING level coverage permanent life insurance policy under  
which the dividends are credited to the policy, thereby reducing the premiums below that usually charged for an  
ordinary life insurance policy. The structure of the policy is such that the dividends are used to purchase increments of  
PAID-UP ADDITIONS of permanent life insurance. As the FACE AMOUNT (FACE OF POLICY) is reduced (usually  
after 2, 3, or 4 years that the policy is issued), the accumulated paid-up additions are generally sufficient to make up the  
difference between the reduced face amount of insurance and the initial face amount of insurance purchased. The  
purpose of this approach is to maintain the DEATH BENEFIT at a level at least equal to the original amount of  
insurance purchased. Most of these policies guarantee that the death benefit will not fall below the original amount of  
insurance purchased, regardless of the fact that the dividends prove to be inadequate to purchase sufficient amounts of  
paid-up additions.  
Another approach to the structuring of this product is to stipulate that the face amount of the policy is equal to 50 to  
90% of the death benefit. The difference between the face amount and the death benefit is comprised of paid-up  
additions of permanent insurance and term insurance purchased by the dividends. This procedure will guarantee that the  
payable death benefit will not fall below that initially purchased.  
< previous page page_154 next page >  
 
< previous page page_155 next page >  
Page 155  
As time goes on, the aggregate paid-up additions should be sufficient so that it is no longer required that term insurance  
be purchased.  
ENROLLED ACTUARY see ACTUARY, ENROLLED.  
ENROLLMENT CARD document used to sign up employees for plans such as salary savings, life insurance, or other  
employee benefits.  
ENTIRE CONTRACT CLAUSE feature of life and health insurance policies that stipulates that the policy represents  
the whole agreement between the insurance company and the insured, and that there are no other outstanding  
agreements.  
ENTITY PLAN see PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE.  
ENURE CLAUSE in an INSURANCE POLICY stipulating that the benefits under the policy will accrue to the right of  
the INSURED. For example, if the insured leaves a violin at a repair shop and that violin, which is insured under the  
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, is stolen, the insurance company will pay the benefits to the insured and not  
to the repair shop.  
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPAIRMENT LIABILITY negligent acts and/or omissions by the individual(s) and the  
organization(s) resulting in damage to the environment. For example, pollution of the environment suits against  
manufacturers are quite common today. The pollution risk is an excluded uninsurable risk under most liability policies;  
however, insurance coverage in some instances is becoming available under ENVIRONMENTAL IMPAIRMENT  
LIABILITY (EIL) INSURANCE policies.  
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPAIRMENT LIABILITY (EIL) INSURANCE coverage in the event that negligent acts and/or  
omissions by individual(s) and organization(s) result in damage to the environment and a liability suit against these  
parties.  
ENVIROSOURCES search engine site that emphasizes the fields of environmental risk management, environmental  
engineering, environmental planning, physical and biological sciences, and various environmental issues of public  
interest. Web site is http://www.envirosource.com.  
EQUIPMENT DEALERS INSURANCE coverage on ALL RISKS basis for such items as binders, reapers, harvesters,  
plows, tractors, pneumatic tools and compressors, bulldozers, and road scrapers. Excluded from coverage are wear and  
tear, loss due to delay, loss of market, consequential loss such as loss of income because of damage to the equipment,  
and mechanical breakdown. Property excluded includes aircraft, water craft, motor vehicles, and property sold on an  
installment contract basis after it has left the care, custody, and control of the insured dealer.  
EQUIPMENT FLOATERS INSURANCE coverage for property that moves from location to location from the perils of  
fire, lightning, explosion, windstorm, earthquake, collapse of bridges, flood, collision

under one of the following forms: AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT INSURANCE; CONTRACTORS EQUIPMENT  
FLOATER; LIVESTOCK INSURANCE; PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS EQUIPMENT INSURANCE.  
EQUITIES representation of ownership rights such as stocks.  
EQUITY fairness (as an objective of insurance pricing). Premium rates are set according to expectation of loss among a  
classification of policyowners. The premise is that all insureds with the same characteristics should have the same  
expectation of loss and should be listed under the same underwriting classification. For example, in life insurance,  
individuals with a good personal health history, family health history, a job with no special hazards, and who are of  
good character, should be classified as standard risks and thereby pay standard rates.  
EQUITY AMONG POLICYOWNERS grouping of applicants for life insurance according to expected mortality, so as  
to produce an under-writing classification in which the spread between health of the worst and best applicant is not so  
great as to skew the distribution curve.  
EQUITY ANNUITIES see VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY.  
EQUITY INDEXED ANNUITY modifications of the SINGLE PREMIUM DEFFERED ANNUITY, which usually  
guarantees at a minimum a return of a stipulated amount (usually at least 90% of the single premium accumulated at the  
annual rate of 3 or 4%). Additional interest can be earned that is linked to an increasing specified stock index. Thus, this  
insurance product guarantees the principal of the investment (single premium), while at the same time providing the  
opportunity for increasing values tied to the equities market. Under the STANDARD NONFORFEITURE LAW, there  
must be guaranteed at the minimum 90% of the single premium accumulated at a rate of at least 3% interest per year.  
The index most often used as a link to this product is the S&P 500. Should the equity index increase, the invested single  
premium could be credited with a percentage of that increase, typically ranging from 50 to 100% of that increase. These  
contracts have terms ranging from one to fifteen years and at the end of the term, the owner/ANNUITANT can start a  
new term or transfer the CASH VALUE to another product. Should the contract be terminated before the end of a term,  
frequently the owner/annuitant forfeits all index gains and will receive only the minimum return guaranteed.  
EQUITY INDEXED UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE insurance in which most of the premium (generally 80 to 90%)  
is invested in traditional fixed income securities. The remainder of the premium is invested in call option contracts tied  
to a stipulated stock index. In those instances where there is an increase in the market, exercising of the option contracts  
takes place and a given percentage of the gain is then credited to the policy. Conversely, should the market decline, the  
option contracts are said to expire worthlessly and the policy is credited with the minimum guaranteed rate. This type of  
policy may be suitable for that

person who has an interest in purchasing a VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE policy but is not at ease in participating in  
the equities market. This type of person could have the best of both worlds: the potential high returns of the equities  
market without the risk to the initial investment (principal).

ERGONOMICS RISK MANAGEMENT control device used to minimize accidents and injuries to employees resulting  
from an unsafe working environment. For example, potential CUMULATIVE TRAUMA DISORDERS losses may be  
lowered by using office furniture that reduces the physical and mental stress resulting from repetitive motions, such as  
constantly reading a computer screen.  
ERISA see EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA).  
ERRORS AND OMISSIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE policies generally available to the various professions that  
require protection for negligent acts and/or omissions resulting in bodily injury, personal injury, and/or property damage  
liability to a client. For example, insurance agents are constantly exposed to the claim that inadequate or improper  
coverage was recommended, resulting in the client suffering a loss of indemnification. If sustained, the agent (or the  
carrier) would have to make good the claim of the client without the adequate insurance coverage.  
ESCROW ACCOUNT funds that the lender collects monthly to pay the monthly MORTGAGE INSURANCE  
premiums, HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY premiums, and yearly property taxes.  
ESTATE sum total of the ASSETS owned by an individual.  
ESTATE EQUALIZATION technique of ESTATE PLANNING under which an estate is divided into two parts and  
taxed at a lower rate rather than remaining as a whole and taxed at a higher rate. This division may be necessary because  
of the progressive nature of the FEDERAL ESTATE TAX.  
ESTATE PLANNING procedure for accumulating, conserving, and distributing personal wealth. In essence, estate  
planning focuses on enhancement of the value of an estate and its conservation. At the death of an owner, estate  
planning seeks to transfer the estate to the heir(s) with a minimum loss in taxes and other expenses. Depending on the  
size and nature of an estate, the expertise of one or more of these specialists may be useful: lawyer, accountant, life  
insurance agent, banker, or a qualified financial or estate planner.

ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION plan that involves distribution of property by living hand and distribution of

ESTATE SETTLEMENT COSTS expenses connected with resolving an estate to include medical expenditures, funeral  
expenditures, probate expenditures, estate taxes, legal fees, and other administrative expenditures.  
ESTATE SHRINKAGE decline in an estate's value, when the estate owner dies, because of death-related expenses to  
include estate taxes, estate administration costs, funeral expenses, and outstanding estate debts. Through proper  
ESTATE PLANNING, this shrinkage can be minimized.

projected loss experience. At the end of the year this premium is adjusted to reflect the actual loss experience. See also  
RETROSPECTIVE RATING.  
ESTOPPEL stop or bar, such that one party makes a statement upon which a second party has every reason to rely,  
thereby preventing the first party from denying the validity of that statement. For example, the misleading actions of an  
agent of the insurance company result in the insured being estopped from having to perform according to the provisions  
of the contract.

EXCESS BENEFIT TRANSACTION transaction by a tax-exempt organization with a person from inside the  
organization (DISQUALIFIED PERSON) that provides an economic benefit to that person that is in excess of the value  
of the consideration received. Compensation that is deemed to be unreasonable comprises an excess benefit and is  
subject to a penalty excise tax under SECTION 4958 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.  
EXCESS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SECTION 401(a), 403(a), 403(b) RETIREMENT PLAN OR IRA plan wherein  
total withdrawal or income payments from tax deferred savings plans exceed  
< previous page page_159 next page >

Page 160  
$150,000 in any one year. An excess distribution tax of 15% of the amount greater than $150,000 must be paid to the  
Internal Revenue Service.  
EXCESS INSURANCE property, liability, or health coverage above the primary amount of insurance. For example, the  
primary coverage is $100,000 and the excess insurance is $1 million. After the losses exceed $100,000, the excess  
insurance will pay for the losses up to a total of $1 million.  
EXCESS INTEREST amount credited to the cash value of an insured's life insurance policy above the minimum  
interest rate it guarantees. This payment is of extreme importance to a policyowner since it will directly affect the size  
of the cash value. See also CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE.  
EXCESS INTEREST WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE type of insurance under which it is assumed that the interest earned  
will exceed the interest rate guaranteed. Excess interest is credited to the policyowner in the following manner:  
1. in a mutual companypaid to policyowners through the policy dividend structure.  
2. in a stock companypaid to policyowners through their cash values or future premiums due. See also CURRENT  
ASSUMPTION WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE.

EXCESS LINE BROKER (SURPLUS LINE BROKER) insurance salesperson who is licensed to place coverage with  
an insurance company that is not licensed to do business in the state of domicile of the broker. The excess line coverage  
must be unavailable from a company licensed in the broker's state.  
EXCESS LOSS COVER see EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE.  
EXCESS (NONPROPORTIONAL) REINSURANCE see EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE.  
EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE method whereby an insurer pays the amount of each claim for each risk up to a  
limit determined in advance and the reinsurer pays the amount of the claim above that limit up to a specific sum. For  
example, assume that an insurer issues automobile liability policies of $150,000 on any one risk and retains the first  
$50,000 of any risk. The insurer purchases excess loss rein-surance for $100,000 in excess of $50,000 on any one risk.  
The insurer pays the first $50,000 of all losses, and the reinsurer pays any excess amount up to a maximum of $100,000.

EXCESS OF TIME REINSURANCE term used in the reinsuring of DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE policies in  
that, after an extended period of time expires (in addition to the ELIMINATION PERIOD found in the disability  
income policy), the REINSURER usually reimburses the CEDING COMPANY for approximately 70 to 80% of the  
monthly disability income payment that the ceding company is required to pay the POLICYHOLDER.  
EXCESS PER RISK REINSURANCE see EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE.  
EXCESS POLICY policy that pays benefits only when coverage under other applicable insurance policies has become

exclusions are: hazards deemed so catastrophic in nature that they are uninsurable, such as war; wear and tear, since  
they are expected through the use of a product; property covered by other insurance, in order to eliminate duplication  
that would profit the insured; liability arising out of contracts; and liability arising out of Workers Compensation laws.

contamination exposure; and liability that may arise if the insured business is found to be in conflict with state liquor  
regulations.  
EXCLUSIONS FROM MEDICAL BENEFITS EXEMPTION found under the ''Exceptions and Exclusions Section for  
All Medical Benefits" in many health insurance policies that exclude:  
1. complications arising from elective, nontherapeutic voluntary abortion.  
2. necessary cosmetic surgery for the immediate repair of a nonoccupational disease, illness, accident, or injury.  
3. custom-built orthopedic shoes, wedges, or arch supports.  
4. speech therapy ordered by a physician to restore partial or complete loss of speech resulting from stroke, cancer,  
radiation laryngitis, or cerebral palsy.  
5. services, supplies, or treatment in connection with or related to endogenous obesity or obesity resulting from external  
causes that the physician certifies is associated with a serious or life-threatening disorder.  
EXCLUSIONS FROM MEDICAL BENEFITS GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE see EXCLUSIONS, MEDICAL

newborn infant; expenses incurred by a member of a HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) or other  
prepaid medical plan; expenses associated with intentional self-inflicted injuries or attempt at suicide; unreasonable  
charges for services or supplies; convenience items such as telephone and television.

dynamite in the home, thereby increasing the chance of loss); property (such as pets); and locations. These are excluded  
because they are uninsurable by nature in that the loss frequency and severity do not lend themselves to accurate  
predictions, the premium rates chargeable would be prohibitive, and in some instances coverages are found in other  
policies.  
EXCLUSIVE AGENCY SYSTEM see CAPTIVE AGENT.  
EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION (EPO) organization that is part of a PREFERRED PROVIDER  
ORGANIZATION (PPO) in which enrollees select an EPO provider to act as their primary care physician and serve as  
the gatekeeper. This gatekeeper approves the maximum level of benefits to which the enrollee is entitled.  
Characteristics of the EPO include emphasis placed on quality of care, utilization of the primary physician, and  
specified financial structure with the providers on a fee-for-service basis.  
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY a procedure in which the employer has ABSOLUTE LIABILITY for the injuries incurred by  
the employee and the employee does not have the right to sue the employer for those injuries suffered. (For job related  
injuries under WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE, the sole source of funds for the injured employee is the  
WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS.)  
EXCULPATORY PROVISION clause in legal contracts that excuses a given party to the contract from liability for  
unintentional negligent acts and/or omissions.  
EXECUTOR fiduciary named in a will to settle an estate of a deceased person. The executor must act as a reasonably

EXPECTED EXPENSE RATIO relationship between expected incurred insurance-related costs (not including claims)  
and expected written premiums. See also EXPENSE RATIO; MANUAL RATE; RATE MAKING.  
EXPECTED EXPENSES anticipated insurance-related costs, not including claims-related costs.  
EXPECTED LOSS probability of loss upon which a basic premium rate is calculated.  
EXPECTED LOSS RATIO proportion of a premium allocated to pay losses, which is equivalent to (1.00 EXPENSE  
RATIO).  
EXPECTED MORBIDITY expectation of illness or injury. The probability of such occurrence is shown by a  
MORBIDITY TABLE, which is important in determining the premiums for health insurance policies.  
EXPECTED MORTALITY expectation of death. The probability of its occurrence is shown by a MORTALITY  
TABLE, which is important in determining the premiums for life insurance policies.  
EXPECTED VALUE sum of money to be received by an insured in the event a given loss occurs.  
EXPEDITED FUNDS AVAILABILITY ACT legislation passed in 1988 by the U.S. Congress to facilitate movement  
of checks through the collection system. As the result of this Act, the Federal Reserve has established rules for the  
endorsement of checks stipulating that the endorsement must be within an area of 1 1/2 inches from the left edge of the  
back of the check and no additional marks or notations can be made on the back of the check beyond this 1 1/2 inch  
boundary.  
EXPEDITING EXPENSES payment by an insurance company to a damaged or destroyed business to hasten its return  
to normal business operations. For example, if a kitchen of a restaurant is damaged by fire, the insurance company may  
be willing to pay overtime wages to enable the restaurant to return to normal operations as soon as possible.  
EXPENSE cost of doing business, not including pure expectation of loss. See also EXPENSE LOADING.  
EXPENSE ALLOWANCE payment to an insurance agent in addition to commissions. Expense allowances, that differ  
from company to company, vary with the amount of business agents place with that company and the need of the  
company to attract future business.  
EXPENSE CONSTANT flat dollar amount that is added to the PURE PREMIUM for an insured risk that is smaller  
than that of the lowest EXPERIENCE RATING band. This dollar amount serves the purpose of generating enough  
additional premium dollar to cover the cost of issuing

and servicing an insurance policy on a risk whose size does not readily allow it to be experience rated.  
EXPENSE LIABILITIES expenses and taxes incurred by the insurance company resulting from the normal business  
activities of the company before the due date of the ANNUAL STATEMENT.  
EXPENSE INCURRED see INCURRED EXPENSE.  
EXPENSE LIMITATION ceiling on expense reimbursement allowance, as stated in New York insurance law, that an  
insurance company licensed in New York State can give its agents. This is one reason why a company that is admitted  
(licensed) in all states but New York may have a sister company doing business only in New York State. If an insurance  
company is not admitted in New York State, it can allocate greater expense allowances and commissions to agents,  
thereby attracting more of their business.  
EXPENSE LOADING amount added to the basic premium (expectation of loss) to cover an insurance company's  
expenses. These expenses include agent commissions, premium taxes, costs of putting a policy on the books, marketing  
support costs, and contingencies. CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS products, in order to be competitive, must emphasize  
low expense loadings. Companies that sell these products make special efforts to control expenses.  
EXPENSE RATIO formula used by insurance companies to relate income and expenses:  
This ratio is of critical importance to the insurance company since it reflects the percentage of the premiums income that  
goes for expenses; that is, how much it costs the company to acquire the premiums, a key element in today's competitive  
marketplace.  
EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ALLOWANCE see EXPENSE ALLOWANCE.  
EXPENSE RESERVE insurance company's liability for incurred but unpaid expenses. See also INCURRED BUT NOT

developing premium rates based on expectation of insured losses.  
EXPERIENCE ACCOUNT loss experience of a given insured.  
EXPERIENCED MORBIDITY actual morbidity experience of an insured group as compared to the EXPECTED  
MORBIDITY for that group.  
EXPERIENCED MORTALITY actual mortality experience of an insured group as compared to the EXPECTED  
MORTALITY for that group.  
EXPERIENCE MODIFICATION adjustment of premiums resulting from the use of EXPERIENCE RATINGS.  
Experience rating plans take the form of retrospective plans or prospective plans. Under retrospective plans, premiums  
are modified after the fact. That is, once the policy period ends, premiums are adjusted to reflect actual loss experience  
of an insured. In contrast, under prospective plans, an insured's past experience (usually for the immediate preceding  
three years) is used to determine the premium for the current year of coverage.  
EXPERIENCE, POLICY YEAR see POLICY YEAR EXPERIENCE.  
EXPERIENCE RATING statistical procedure used to calculate a premium rate based on the loss experience of an  
insured group. Applied in group insurance, it is the opposite of manual rates. Here the premiums paid are related to  
actual claims and expense experience expected for that specific group. In PROSPECTIVE RATING, the past three  
years loss experience of the insured is the basis for the premium calculation for the current year of coverage. In  
RETROSPECTIVE RATING, the current premium rate for the current period of time is modified at the close of that  
period to reflect actual loss experience. The premium actually paid then can be adjusted, subject to a pre-agreed  
minimum and maximum rate.  
EXPERIENCE REFUND return of a percentage of premium paid by a business firm if its loss record is better than the  
amount loaded into the basic premium. See also EXPERIENCE MODIFICATION.

excluded from general business liability policies. Coverage for this exclusion can be acquired at an extra premium  
through an ENDORSEMENT to the various business liability policies.  
EXPLOSION INSURANCE see EXTENDED COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT.  
EXPORT-IMPORT BANK partnership between an agency of the U.S. government and the Foreign Credit Insurance  
Association (50 commercial insurance companies, both stock and mutual). Insures that businesses are indemnified for  
losses resulting from uncollectible accounts for goods sold in foreign markets. Additional perils covered are war,  
insurrection, confiscation, and/or currency devaluation. This coverage encourages American businesses to sell their  
products in foreign markets.  
EXPOSURE possibility of loss. The most cost efficient way to purchase insurance is to insure an unexpected loss with a  
low probability of occurrence. Insuring a loss with a high probability of occurrence means swapping dollars with an  
insurance company, since the premium charged would reflect the expected probability of loss. Expense and profit  
loadings would also be added by the insurer. See also SELF INSURANCE.  
EXPRESSED WARRANTY see WARRANTY.  
EXPROPRIATION INSURANCE coverage against foreign country expropriation underwritten by the OVERSEAS  
PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION (OPIC) for U.S.-owned companies investing in given developing  
countries.  
EXTENDED COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT added to an INSURANCE POLICY or a CLAUSE found in an insurance  
policy that will provide additional coverage for RISKS to be insured other than those covered under the basic policy's  
PROVISIONS.  
EXTENDED COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT extension of coverage available under the Standard Fire Policy. The  
standard policy only covers the perils of fire and lightning. The endorsement covers riot, riot attending a strike, civil  
commotion, smoke, aircraft and vehicle damage, windstorm, hail, and explosion.  
EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD INSURANCE (ERPI) policy underwritten on either a monoline primary insurance  
or monoline EXCESS INSURANCE basis that will allow the purchaser to increase the limits of liability coverage above  
that of policies already purchased as well as fill gaps in liability coverages. These policies usually provide liability  
protection on a worldwide basis to include coverage for bodily injury, property damage, products-completed operations,  
premises and operations, and personal injury. The period for claims reporting can be on a fixed or unlimited basis. Legal  
defense expenses and other supplementary expenses can be included within the policy limits or can be in addition to the  
policy limits. An endorsement can be added to provide coverage for known circumstances, thereby permitting the  
purchaser  
< previous page page_167 next page >  
 
< previous page page_168 next page >  
Page 168  
to retroactively add additional limits of coverage for current evolving liability situations. In addition, this policy can  
provide coverage for residual liability exposures by focusing on a particular risk.  
EXTENDED TERM INSURANCE nonforfeiture option that uses the cash value of an ordinary life policy as a single  
premium to purchase term life insurance in the amount of the original policy. The length of the term policy depends on  
(1) the size of the cash value and (2) the attained age of the insured.  
EXTORTION INSURANCE coverage in the event of threats to injure an insured or damage or destroy his property.  
EXTRA DIVIDEND DIVIDEND paid in addition to the regular dividend on a PARTICIPATING INSURANCE policy.  
EXTRA EXPENSE INSURANCE form that covers exposures associated with efforts to operate a business that is  
damaged by a peril such as fire. For example, a special electrical generator may have to be purchased in the event of a  
long-range loss of electricity if the business is to continue to operate.  
EXTRA PERCENTAGE TABLES form of substandard ratings that shows additions to standard premiums to reflect  
physical impairments of applicants for life or health insurance. The additions reflect the greater probability of mortality  
or morbidity. See also SUBSTANDARD HEALTH INSURANCE; SUBSTANDARD LIFE INSURANCE.  
EXTRA PREMIUM addition to reflect exposures with a greater probability of loss than standard exposures. For  
example, insuring a munitions factory obviously requires a premium greater than that required for insuring an  
accounting office.  
EXTRATERRITORIALITY provision in WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE under which an employee

characterized by a high degree of care taken for safety and potential loss reduction).  
FACTORY MUTUAL organization of a group of insurers composed of mutual property and casualty insurance  
companies, a subsidiary stock insurance company, and a subsidiary safety engineering company. Their objective is to  
provide insurance and safety engineering services for large manufacturing companies, substantial housing projects,  
public institutions, and educational institutions. Coverage includes the perils of fire, explosion, windstorm, riot, civil  
commotion, sprinkler leakage, malicious mischief, damage to vehicles, and damage to aircraft. Field offices staffed by  
salaried personnel deal directly with insureds; there is no agency field force.  
FACTUAL EXPECTATION strong expectation of an occurrence resulting in a monetary interest that gives rise to an  
insurable interest. For example, a daughter has a strong expectation of wearing her mother's wedding gown and thus has  
an insurable interest in the gown even though the gown is still the property of her mother.  
FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE term under which the REINSURER exercises its faculty or prerogative to insure a  
risk or reject a risk from a CEDING COMPANY.  
FACULTATIVE OBLIGATORY TREATY hybrid between FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE and treaty reinsurance  
where the CEDING COMPANY may elect to assign certain risks that the reinsurer is obligated to accept.

FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE individual risk offered by an insurer for acceptance or rejection by a reinsurer. Both  
parties are free to act in their own best interests regardless of any prior contractual arrangements. With proportional  
facultative reinsurance, the reinsurer assumes a proportional share of premiums and losses. On a nonproportional basis,  
the reinsurer is liable only for losses which exceed the insurer's retention level; premiums vary with loss expectation.  
FAILURE MODE AND EFFECT ANALYSIS analytical procedure to predict the failure rate of a system still in the  
design stage.  
FAILURE TO PERFORM EXCLUSION coverage that is excluded under COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY  
INSURANCE (COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE) for the loss of use of undamaged tangible  
real or personal property as the result of failure of the performance of a product or service as warranted or represented  
by the insured.  
FAIR ACCESS TO INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (FAIR) PLAN insurance that grew out of the urban  
demonstrations and riots of the 1960s. Because of the deteriorated social and economic circumstances in these areas, it  
became impossible for many business owners and homeowners to purchase property insurance. As a result, the federal  
government established the FAIR plans based on the stop loss reinsurance method. If a business owner or homeowner  
cannot purchase property insurance through conventional means, application can be made through an agent who  
represents an insurance company participating in the FAIR plan. If the property is acceptable to the company, insurance  
will be provided. If the property is deficient, improvements are suggested, and upon compliance the policy is issued.  
FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT federal legislation giving an insurance applicant the right to contact a reporting  
organization doing a credit check and be advised of information contained in the applicant's file showing the reason for  
rejection for insurance.  
FAIR PLAN see FAIR ACCESS TO INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (FAIR) PLAN.  
FALLEN BUILDING CLAUSE section in some property insurance contracts that eliminates further coverage for  
buildings after they have collapsed from causes other than fire or explosion. For example, fire coverage would not be  
applicable to buildings that collapse because of inherent defects.  
FALSE IMPRISONMENT tort of wrongful physical confinement of an individual. This is not restricted to physical  
confinement but includes any unjustified limitation of another's freedom of movement. If an individual is intimidated

them room and board, surgical and physician costs, drugs and medicines, blood, ambulance service to and from the  
hospital, X-rays, and floor nursing. See also INSURANCE.  
FAMILY HISTORY background information used in life and health insurance underwriting to ascertain the probability  
of hereditary disease. The purpose is to determine if the disease is of such a nature that the life expectancy of an  
applicant will be adversely affected, and if so, to what degree.  
FAMILY INCOME POLICY contract combining whole life and decreasing term insurance. A monthly income is paid  
to a beneficiary if an insured dies during a specific period. At the end of that period, the full face amount of the policy is  
also paid to the beneficiary. It is designed to provide income for a household while the children are still young. If an  
insured dies after the specified period, only the face amount of the policy is paid. For example, the face value of a  
family income policy is $100,000 and the specified period is 20 years. If the insured dies 10 years into the specified  
period, the beneficiary receives a monthly income of 1% of the face amount ($1000) for the remaining 10 years. At the  
end of the 10 years, the beneficiary also receives $100,000. If the insured dies after the 20-year specified period, the  
beneficiary receives $100,000, which is the face amount. See also FAMILY INCOME RIDER; FAMILY  
MAINTENANCE POLICY.  
FAMILY INCOME RIDER attachment of decreasing term life insurance to an ordinary life policy to provide monthly  
income to a beneficiary if death occurs during a specified period. If the insured dies after the specified period, only the  
face value is paid to the beneficiary since the decreasing term insurance has expired. See also FAMILY INCOME  
POLICY.  
FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP partnership in which family members hold all interest in the partnership. This  
partnership is treated as a cash flow through stand-alone entity. All sums of income and

Page 172  
credits, as well as deductions, flow through the partnership to the partners on a pro rata basis. The partners report their  
pro rata share on their individual personal income tax returns.  
FAMILY MAINTENANCE POLICY combination of whole life and level term that provides income to a beneficiary  
for a selected period of time (e.g., 20 years) if an insured dies during that period. At the end of the income-paying  
period the beneficiary also receives the entire face amount of the policy. If an insured dies after the end of the selected  
period, the beneficiary receives only the face value of the policy. The remainder of the benefits are the same as under  
the FAMILY INCOME POLICY. See also FAMILY INCOME RIDER.  
FAMILY POLICY contract providing whole life insurance on the father and term insurance on the mother and all  
children, including newborns after reaching a stated age, usually 15 days. Children, upon reaching the age of majority,  
have the right to convert their insurance to a permanent policy up to the amount of term coverage without having to  
show evidence of insurability (take a physical examination). The premium is the same regardless of the number of  
children covered.

FAMILY SUPPORT ACT OF 1988 legislation that changed the tax treatment concerning child-care expenses so that an  
employee who has incurred child-care expenses greater than $4800 and who is participating in a company-sponsored  
dependent care assistance program is required to choose between the company plan and the child-care credit. The tax  
benefit gained by the employee from the child-care credit is reduced dollar for dollar to the extent that the company plan  
is used to cover child-care expenses.  
FARMERS COMPREHENSIVE PERSONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE provides the same coverage as a  
COMPREHENSIVE PERSONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE policy, plus coverage to exposures that are peculiar to  
farms, such as farm business operations, farm employees engaged in farm business activities, and liability arising out of  
selling farm products.  
FARMOWNERS AND RANCHOWNERS INSURANCE package coverage for a dwelling and its contents, barns,  
stables, and other land structures as well as liability coverage. By means of a number of special forms that follow the  
format of the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, this insurance protects a number of named perils and liabilities.

FAYOL, HENRI French industrialist whose thesis is that all business activities revolve around six areas: technical  
(production), commercial (buying and selling), financing (capital employment), accounting (financial record keeping),  
managerial (planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, controlling), and security (protection of property against loss  
and the physical safety of individuals). Fayol's view of security has become the RISK MANAGEMENT of modern  
business.

FEDERAL CRIME INSURANCE protection under the auspices of the federal government where such insurance cannot  
be purchased by a homeowner, business owner, or tenant at affordable community rates. A homeowner's or tenant's  
personal property is covered for burglary and/or robbery, and premises for damage due to burglary and robbery. A  
business owner's fixtures, furniture, equipment, merchandise, money, and securities due are covered for burglary and/or  
robbery. See also FEDERAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION.  
FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE protection against natural disasters that may strike crops. Coverage on ALL RISKS  
basis began in 1948 under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Premiums reflect actual losses incurred  
by farmers. The objective is to level out farmers' income that otherwise would be adversely affected by natural disasters  
striking their crops. See also FEDERAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION.  
FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC)agency formed as the result of bank failures in the 1930s  
to insure the deposits of customers of member banks. The FDIC, an agency of the federal government, is self-supporting  
in that it receives fees from the member banks at the rate of .5% of the bank's deposits and the income from reserves  
that have been invested. Each account is insured up to $100,000.

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT (FDICIA) OF 1991 act that provides  
new funding for the Bank Insurance Fund and enhances the safety and soundness of the financial system. The FDICIA  
includes the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act (FBSEA) of 1991, whose purpose is to enhance the authority  
of the Federal Reserve to supervise the entry of foreign banks into the United States banking system. Once having  
entered, the supervision would extend to the foreign banks operating within the system as well.  
FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 TITLE I, SUBTITLE D act  
providing that stringent regulatory actions may be taken against depository institutions according to their level of capital  
adequacy: (1) well capitalized; (2) adequately capitalized; (3) undercapitalized; (4) significantly undercapitalized; and  
(5) critically undercapitalized.  
If an institution is classified as well capitalized or adequately capitalized, no special regulatory steps must be taken, but  
those institutions that fall into the three remaining categories are subject to progressively more demanding restrictions.  
If an institution is declared to be undercapitalized, the following applies: (1) the institution must adopt an acceptable  
capital restoration plan; (2) limits are placed on the institution's growth; (3) capital distributions cannot be made; and (4)  
acquisitions and establishment of new branches cannot be made without prior approval of its capital plan.  
If an institution is declared to be significantly undercapitalized, the institution must: (1) sell shares; (2) restrict interest  
paid on deposits; (3) restrict the growth of assets; (4) prohibit the receiving of deposits from correspondent banks; and  
(5) terminate particular executive officers and/or directors.  
If an institution is declared to be critically undercapitalized, it cannot: (1) pay interest on subordinated debt; (2) repay  
principal on subordinated debt; (3) participate in highly leveraged transactions without prior FDIC approval; (4) make  
material changes in accounting methods; (5) pay excessive compensation or bonuses; (6) change its charters or by-laws;  
and (7) engage in transactions that require prior notice to the primary regulator to include expansion, acquisition, or the  
sale of assets.  
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (FEGLI) plan administered through a primary private life  
insurer and reinsured through other private life insurers, providing a death benefit equal to: (1) one year's salary for  
active employees at least age 45 until they reach age 65; and (2) two years' salary for active employees age 35 and  
under. The death benefit is graduated for federal employees age 36 through 44. After retirement, the full death benefit  
remains in force until the retired employee reaches age 65, whereupon the death bene-

< previous page page_175 next page >  
Page 175  
fit is reduced by 2% per month until it levels off at 25% of the employee preretirement annual salary. The federal  
government pays approximately one-third of the monthly premium, and the employee pays the remainder.  
FEDERAL EMPLOYERS LIABILITY ACT (FELA) federal law comparable to state workers compensation statutes  
setting out liability of railroads for work-related injuries or death of their employees. Railroad employees are not  
covered by workers compensation laws. Under normal tort law, the injured party must prove he or she did nothing to  
contribute to the negligence or the risk. But under the terms of the federal act, railroad employees must only show that  
negligence on the part of the employer contributed to the injury. Therefore, this law gives railroads responsibility for onthe- 
job injuries to employees. But the railroads are not protected by the theory that workers compensation should be the  
only responsibility of employers for their employees, or by the prescribed schedule of benefits.  
FEDERAL ESTATE TAX federal tax imposed on the estate of a decedent according to the value of that estate. The first  
step in the computation of the federal estate tax owed is to determine the value of the decedent's gross estate. This  
determination can be made by adding the following values of assets owned by the decedent at the time of death:  
1. property owned outright.  
2. gratuitous lifetime transfers, but with the stipulation that the decedent retained the income or control over the income.  
3. gratuitous lifetime transfers subject to the recipient's surviving the decedent.  
4. gratuitous lifetime transfers subject to the decedent's retaining the right to revoke, amend, or alter the gift.  
5. annuities purchased by the decedent that are payable for the lifetime of the named survivor as well as the annuitant.  
6. property jointly held in such a manner that another party receives the decedent's interest in that property at the  
decedent's death because of that party's survivorship.  
7. life insurance in which the decedent retained incidents of ownership.  
8. life insurance that was payable to the decedent's estate.  
The second step in the computation of the federal estate tax owed is to subtract allowable deductions (including  
bequests to charities, bequests to the surviving spouse, funeral expenses, and other administration expenses) from the  
gross estate. This results in the taxable estate. Adjustable taxable gifts are then added to the taxable estate, resulting in  
the computational tax base. From the table below, the appropriate tax rate is then applied to the computational tax base,  
resulting in the tentative (certain credits may still be subtracted) federal estate tax.

Note that the above tax schedule is applicable to the taxable estate only after the adjustment for settlement costs, administrative expenses, and  
the unified estate and gift tax credit.  
It is important to note that there is an unlimited marital deduction (the estate of the decedent passes to the spouse free of federal estate taxes)  
and that all federal estate taxes are eliminated on estates having a computational tax base of $650,000 or less in 1999. The unified credit will  
be increased from the current $650,000 to $1,000,000 in the year 2006 accoding to the following schedule:

FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE coverage made available to residents of a community on a subsidized and nonsubsidized premium rate  
basis once the governing body of the community qualifies that community for coverage under the National Flood Insurance Act. Residents  
include business and nonbusiness operations with coverage

Page 177  
written on structures and their contents. Coverage is purchased through licensed agents. Prior to passage of the Housing  
and Urban Development Act of 1968, of which the National Flood Insurance Act is a part, it was virtually impossible to  
obtain flood insurance coverage on an industrial building, residential building, retailing building, or a single family  
dwelling.  
FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE: UPTON-JONES AMENDMENT amendment that modifies the FEDERAL FLOOD  
INSURANCE program by providing relocation and acquisition coverage for structures in imminent danger from an  
encroaching shoreline. This amendment enables the Federal Flood Insurance Program to pay up to 40% of the policy to  
property owners who relocate structures in imminent danger and up to 110% of the policy to property owners who  
demolish those structures and remove the debris. A prerequisite for the property owner to receive these funds is for the  
property structures to be declared uninhabitable by the local permit authority and to be subject to erosion or to be within  
the geographical boundaries of an erosion zone that has been included in a program approved by the state. Under the  
Federal Flood Insurance Program, residential structures on the shore can be insured against floods for a maximum  
amount of $185,000 and $60,000 coverage for contents within the structure.

Congress. However, this does not prevent the FTC from conducting investigations into the insurance industry. For  
example, in 1970 the Congress charged the FTC with the responsibility of enforcing the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING  
ACT, which requires an insurance company to notify an insurance applicant of an impending INSPECTION REPORT  
and to release information so collected to the applicant upon request. If the report results in the applicant's rejection for  
insurance, he must be notified of the adverse report and his right to its contents. Perhaps the best known FTC

practices.

FIDELITY AND SURETY CATASTROPHE INSURANCE mechanism used by a fidelity and surety insurance  
company to spread its liability through REINSURANCE by issuing a surplus treaty as a first layer of coverage, thereby  
enabling a cedent to limit its liability on the business written, while at the same time utilizing the flexibility that the  
surplus method offers. The reinsurance catastrophe cover provides a second layer of coverage. Reinsurance covers are  
used by the insurance company to:  
1. avoid accumulation of liability on individual principles. Warehouse bonds are an example of such accumulations,  
because they are required in great number and they result in large aggregate amounts.  
2. achieve a balance among the various types of bonds that the insurer assumes.  
3. reduce violent fluctuations in experiencing high loss ratios on many classes of bonds.  
FIDELITY BOND coverage that guarantees that the insurance company will pay the insured business or individual for  
money or other property lost because of dishonest acts of its bonded employees, either named or by positions. The bond  
covers all dishonest acts, such as larceny, theft, embezzlement, forgery, misappropriation, wrongful abstraction, or  
willful misapplication, whether employees act alone or as a team. Businesses often bond their employees not only  
because the insurance will pay for the losses, but also because the bonding company may prevent losses by uncovering  
dishonesty in the work history of a new

employee. Since a fidelity bond makes up only a part of protection against theft, other crime insurance is mandatory.  
Employee dishonesty insurance is usually bought through an individual Fidelity Bond, BLANKET POSITION BOND,  
COMMERCIAL BLANKET BOND, or a NAME SCHEDULE BOND.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) group that, with the exception of the government,  
establishes the standards for all financial accounting and reporting for the various entities in the United States. The  
standards enable comparability and consistency for financial statements among companies. The Securities and  
Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that all SEC registrants adhere to the FASB Standards when reporting financial  
information. The SEC also requires that members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)  
adhere to the FASB requirements when reporting financial data. The FASB is under the control of the Financial  
Accounting Foundation that provides it with financial support. The accounting firms, corporations, and others who  
utilize the information lend the financial support. An appointed advisory task force of outside experts representing the  
various views of auditors, preparers, and users review projects. With the help of the FASB staff, the task force issues a  
statement concerning the actual standards by which to abide, their effective date, research leading to the conclusions,  
and the logic upon which the conclusions are based.  
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) 5 rule for accounting for contingencies that has  
application for the accounting of liabilities under the COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,  
COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 (CERCLA). The act states that recognition must be given when a  
loss is probable and estimable. If the best estimate is a possible range for the loss, the low-end number must be  
recognized. When the minimum criteria for recognition has not been met, the act requires full disclosure if there is at  
least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred.  
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) 87 new pension-accounting rule created by the  
Financial Accounting Standards Board. The objective of this rule is to clarify pension accounting so that investors,  
employers, and employees will know what the assets and liabilities of a particular pension plan are. The rule requires  
that a company disclose all relevant figures concerning its pension plan on the face of the company's income statement.  
Previously, the company could bury these figures in the footnotes of the income statement. Also, under the new  
disclosure requirement, the expected liabilities of the pension plan must be recalculated annually, assuming market  
interest rates. Thus, a company's pension liabilities each year will rise or fall according to the market interest rate,  
thereby affecting the company's income statement and balance sheet.  
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) 106 new pension-accounting rule (Employers  
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) which mandates that employers that provide  
postretirement benefits to include life insurance, medical, or dental begin accruing an expense against current income  
for the expected future cost of such benefits. Additionally, the  
< previous page page_181 next page >  
 
< previous page page_182 next page >  
Page 182  
employer must list on the balance sheet a liability entry reflecting the total expected amount to be owed for the future  
benefit cost.  
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) 112 new rule entitled "Employers Accounting for  
Postemployment Benefits," which requires advanced recognition of nonretirement benefits, health insurance  
continuation, and severance pay.  
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) 113 new rule entitled "Accounting and Reporting for  
Reinsurance of Short-duration and Long-duration Contracts," which requires the INSURANCE COMPANY to report  
all assets and liabilities relating to REINSURANCE contracts on its FINANCIAL STATEMENTS on a gross basis  
rather than on the net of the influence of reinsurance, as had been the historical reporting method. This rule establishes  
parameters for the determination of whether or not a specific RISK has actually been transferred under a reinsurance  
contract. In order to be classified as a reinsurance contractthat is, one of a risk-transferring naturethe rule requires a  
reasonable possibility that the REINSURER may assume significant loss for accepting the insurance risk.  
Thus, a contract will be considered reinsurance only if it transfers significant insurance risk to the reinsurer, and if it is  
reasonably possible the reinsurer will suffer a significant loss under the reinsurance contract. Obligations owed to  
reinsurers under multi-year contracts must be reported as liabilities by the CEDING COMPANY and, at the same time,  
the reinsurer must report these obligations as assets on the balance sheet. However, if the ceding company incurs a  
profit under the multi-year contract resulting from good loss experience, the profit is shown as an asset on its balance  
sheet and the reinsurer shows this amount as a liability on its balance sheet.  
Thus, this rule established new generally accepted accounting principles for REINSURANCE to include the following:  
(1) reinsurance is defined for accounting purposes to exclude transactions that do not subject the REINSURER to the  
reasonable possibility of a substantial loss from the insurance risk assumed or does not transfer the underwriting risk;  
(2) retroactive and prospective provisions within the same reinsurance contract must be separately accountedif the  
separate accounting is not possible, the total reinsurance contract must be accounted for on a retroactive basis; (3)  
reinsurance recoverables must be reported as an asset on the balance sheet and the total reinsured claim liability to  
include the INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED LOSSES (IBNR) reserves and recoverables on outstanding claims  
must be reported; (4) the CEDING COMPANY must defer gains on retroactive contracts and amortize these gains over  
the expected period of time necessary to settle the claims; and (5) insurer must disclose concentrations of credit risk  
resulting from reinsurance recoverables, and receivables.

Equity Securities," which requires most fixed maturity investments to be listed on the INSURANCE COMPANY'S  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at MARKET VALUE beginning in 1994. This rule stipulates three categories of  
investment to be affected:  
1. Securities Available for Salesecurities that are available for sale but are not considered securities held for trading.  
2. Securities Held to Maturitysecurities that the insurance company has both the intent and ability to hold to maturity.  
Such securities would be listed on the company's financial statement at amortized cost. See also AMORTIZATION;  
AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE.  
3. Trading Securitiessecurities that are bought for the purpose of trading in order to realize a profit. These securities are  
listed on the financial statements valued at market with any changes in the market value recorded on the income  
statement.  
All of the above adjustments result in increases as well as decreases in book value and thus will have a direct effect on  
the numerous calculations that are a function of the book value, such as the return on equity.  
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS investment and savings position of an insured used in determining the amount of  
life insurance to purchase. The amount of investment and savings is subtracted from the total insurance requirement.  
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY, AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989 (FIRREA) legislation  
designed to provide the structural reform necessary to strengthen the thrift industry after the bailout of the insolvent  
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) in 1989. The Act is designed to accomplish the following  
through regulatory reform: to establish a stable system for affordable housing financing; to place the FSLIC insurance  
funds on a sound financial basis; to manage and resolve failed savings associations and, if necessary, to provide the  
funds required to deal expeditiously with failed savings associations; to improve the supervision of savings associations;  
and to strengthen the enforcement powers of federal regulators of savings associations. If the preceding aims are  
accomplished, the federal regulators will have the necessary power and capital to terminate insolvent savings  
associations in an effective and efficient manner before the crisis stage is reached.  
FINANCIAL INSURANCE structured product designed to meet specific needs of the insured that may involve any of  
the following funding arrangements: (1) loss portfolio transfers in which the self-insurer transfers the reserves that it had  
established for its known losses to the insurance company; by concluding such a transfer, the self-insurer can use the  
capital it had previously set aside for loss reserves; (2) retrospective transfers in which a self-insurer has losses for  
which inadequate insurance coverage exists and now these companies require additional insurance coverages so that the  
limits can be raised to an  
< previous page page_183 next page >  
 
< previous page page_184 next page >  
Page 184  
adequate amount; and (3) prospective loss transfers in which a self-insurer has a requirement to fund in advance its  
future losses, thereby removing its liability for loss reserves from its balance sheet. The premium paid by the selfinsurer  
to the insurance company reflects the self-insurer's expectation of loss.  
Under the three funding approaches, the self-insurer must have adequate loss experience so that the LAW OF LARGE  
NUMBERS will be able to operate; that is, so that the credibility of the prediction will approach one and the standard  
deviation of the actual losses (X) from the expected losses (X) will approach zero. This statistical base is important  
because the self-insurer's loss experience is not combined with another self-insurer's loss experience to form an overall  
statistical bank from which to develop premiums for a specific category of self-insurers.  
This specifically designed structured product enables the self-insurer to eliminate its liability for maintaining loss  
reserves. Also, this product enables the self-insurer to protect itself against adverse future loss experience resulting in  
earnings per share not being affected by unexpected losses.  
FINANCIAL PLANNING acquisition and employment of ASSETS in order to maximize the return on these assets  
through: (1) establishment of FINANCIAL PLANNING OBJECTIVES; (2) development of financial plans by which  
these objectives are to be achieved; (3) establishment of a budget by which funds can be allocated to the purchase of the  
financial assets; and (4) review and, if necessary, revision of the financial plan to make sure acceptable progress is being  
made toward the achievement of the objectives.  
FINANCIAL PLANNING OBJECTIVES goals of the financial planning process as follows:  
1. Standard of LivingMaslow's basic needs satisfied such as food, water, clothing, shelter, and nice-to-have  
discretionary items, such as automobiles, vacations, entertainment.  
2. Savingsemergency funds for sudden and unexpected events, such as extra living expenses because of a fire at one's  
home.  
3. ProtectionDISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE; HEALTH INSURANCE; LIFE INSURANCE; PROPERTY AND  
LIABILITY INSURANCE (all forms designed to offer coverage against the uncertainty of a financial loss due to the  
PURE RISK).  
4. InvestmentAccumulation of wealth through the return on assets deployed leading to financial independence.  
5. Estate Planningdistribution of the invested assets held for the purpose of the accumulation of wealth in a tax efficient  
and effective manner.  
FINANCIAL REINSURANCE transaction of REINSURANCE under which there is a limit on the total liability of the  
REINSURER and future investment income is a recognized component of the underwriting

process. This financial instrument incorporates the time value of money into the CEDING process such that the  
CEDENT can reinsure its liabilities at a premium rate less than the true rate for the liabilities transferred (difference in  
the two rates to be made up by the investment income generated during the years the reinsurance contract remains in  
force). Financial reinsurance can be used effectively in several situations:  
1. surplus relief (QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE)CEDING COMPANY transfers a percentage of its book of  
business to the reinsurer (the reinsurer will limit its total liability under any one contract).  
2. portfolio transfersceding company transfers reserves on known losses to the reinsurer in exchange for premiums  
equal to the present value of the future claims experience.  
3. retrospective aggregatesceding company transfers reserves on known losses as well as INCURRED BUT NOT  
REPORTED LOSSES (IBNR).  
4. prospective aggregatesceding company pays a premium on a PROSPECTIVE RATING basis to the reinsurer. In  
exchange, the rein-surer is obligated to pay future losses incurred by the cedent. If these future losses are less than  
expected, the cedent will receive the UNDERWRITING GAIN. Any gains from investments and fees will be retained  
by the reinsurer. Through this mechanism, in essence, the cedent gains current capacity for writing additional business  
by borrowing against income to be received in the future.  
5. catastrophe protectioncoverage against shock losses is provided by spreading the payment of such losses over several  
years.  
FINANCIAL REPORTING recording and presentation of financial statements, such as the ANNUAL STATEMENT,  
by the insurance company. Financial reporting statements are used by the State Insurance Commissioner in regulating  
the adequacy of company reserves for benefit liabilities, assets availability, and worth.  
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CLAUSE provision in automobile insurance, such as the PERSONAL  
AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP), stating that a particular policy furnishes adequate coverage, the minimum of which is  
at least equal to that required by the financial responsibility laws in the state in which the insured is driving.  
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAW law requiring the operator of an automobile to show financial ability to pay for  
automobile-related losses. In many states evidence usually takes the form of a minimum amount of automobile liability  
insurance.  
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT management of investment risks associated with BUSINESS RISK, INTEREST  
RATE RISK, POLITICAL RISK, and PURCHASING POWER RISK. Usually fixed income financial instruments,  
such as fixed dollar life insurance, fixed dollar annuities, and bonds, are most susceptible to business, purchasing power,  
interest rate, and political risks. Variable dollar life insurance, variable dollar annuities, and common stocks are most  
subject to business, market, and political risks.

FINANCING securement of funds from outside sources such as by borrowing or by attracting equity control. Use of  
leverage to improve the profitability of a business. Achievement of an investment return on the borrowed funds at a  
higher rate than the interest being paid for the use of the funds.  
FINDER'S FEE monetary sum paid to an intermediary who acts as the contact between the lender (an insurance

FINE ART DEALERS INSURANCE coverage for works of art, antiques, and similar articles of value on ALL RISKS  
basis, subject to exclusion of wear and tear, war, breakage, repairing, infidelity of the insured's employees, and  
mysterious disappearance. Fine Arts Insurance Policies are written on a scheduled basis with damaged or destroyed  
items being indemnified on a valued basis. The same type of coverage for fine arts is available through a Fine Arts  
Endorsement for a SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP) policy.  
FINE ARTS AND ANTIQUES INSURANCE coverage for paintings, pictures, etchings, tapestries, art glass windows,  
antique furniture, coin collections, and stamp collections owned by individuals and businesses. These works are not  
covered if owned by dealers or auction firms. Protection is on an ALL RISKS basis subject to exclusions of damage  
from ordinary breakage, wear and tear, war, and nuclear disaster. Each item must be specifically listed and valued in the  
policy.  
FINITE RISK INSURANCE type of insurance that provides a single aggregate limit of coverage within the insurance  
policy terms, thereby limiting the insurance company's liability for a RISK transferred to it. The insurance coverage is  
tailored to the requirements of the INSURED company to reflect the insured's actual coverage needs. If the insured's  
losses are favorable, the insured receives the return of a portion of the premium paid. The insured's premium costs are  
based on the insured's own loss experience, rather than the overall loss experience of a pool of similar insureds. In  
essence, through this type of insurance, the insured pays for exposure to loss and if there is not a substantial loss, the  
insured receives the return of a portion of the premium paid in. This insurance mechanism is ideal for insureds who  
exhibit a frequency distribution of high severity loss or an unusual loss frequency. See also FINANCIAL  
REINSURANCE.

component of the

UNDERWRITING process. Also, the ultimate liability of the reinsurer is limited. The reinsurer cannot cancel these  
contracts, but the CEDING COMPANY may exchange this contract for another contract.  
FIRE intense combustion resulting in a flame or glow. In order for the fire PERIL to be covered under PROPERTY  
INSURANCE, the fire must be a HOSTILE FIRE, not a FRIENDLY FIRE.  
FIRE CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE means used by a direct fire underwriter to protect against accumulation for a  
fire account, as well as against extremely large fire account liability. For example, heavy liabilities under individual  
risks can be analyzed by the initial fire underwriter to determine the number of separate fire risks involved. The  
reinsurance method applied to the risks is a QUOTA SHARE or surplus share treaty with the use of a FACULTATIVE  
REINSURANCE cover if necessary. Under this method, the reinsurer assumes the liability of a proportionate share of  
the risks in exchange for a proportionate share of the premiums. An extremely large number of losses under individual  
risks caused by a single event, commonly referred to as a conflagration hazard, arises when different risks may be  
affected by one fire. An example would be widespread damage to many adjacent private houses. While the loss for each  
retained individual risk would be small, the aggregate would be so large that it would affect the stability of the fire  
insurance company. Catastrophe reinsurance would protect any SURPLUS REINSURANCE and EXCESS OF LOSS  
REINSURANCE up to a stated amount.  
FIRE DEPARTMENT SERVICE CLAUSE in PROPERTY INSURANCE policies, provision that states that the  
INSURED will receive INDEMNITY for expenses incurred as a result of acts by the fire department taken to save or  
reduce damage to the insured's property. For example, if the insured has a house outside the fire district, the fire  
department might charge a fee for responding to a fire call.  
FIRE DIVISION separation of a building into distinct separate parts by FIRE WALL or open air spaces between  
buildings to minimize the probability of a fire spreading horizontally or vertically.  
FIRE DOOR partition of noncombustible material in a wall of similar material, designed when closed to slow the spread  
of fire from one side of the wall to the other. The NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION rates the doors  
according to the number of hours they can be expected to withstand fire before burning through.  
FIRE EXTINGUISHER instrument that uses noncombustible substances such as carbon dioxide to deprive a fire of  
oxygen, thereby extinguishing it.

FIRE INSURANCESTANDARD FIRE POLICY policy known as the 165-line policy because of the standard form  
used in most states. The policy is not complete, and additional forms and endorsements are added so that it can cover  
numerous direct and indirect risks. The Standard Fire Policy is Section Iproperty coverage of most package policies  
such as the HOMEOWNERS and SPECIAL MULTIPERIL. It provides the foundation for property insurance coverages  
regardless of the form in which they appear. The Standard Fire Policy has four sections:  
1. DECLARATIONSdescription and location of property, insured amount, name of insured.  
2. INSURING AGREEMENTSpremium amount, obligations of the insured, actions the insured must take in the event  
of loss and resultant claim.  
3. Conditionsdescribes that which suspends or restricts the coverage, such as an increase in the hazard with the  
knowledge of the insured.  
4. EXCLUSIONSperils not covered under the policy, such as enemy attack, including action taken by military force in  
resisting actual or immediately impending enemy attack.  
Forms that can be added to a Standard Fire Policy include Dwelling Buildings and Contents Basic Form; Dwelling,  
Buildings and Contents Broad Form; GENERAL PROPERTY FORM. Since the Standard Fire Policy insures only  
against fire and lightning, the EXTENDED COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT can cover the additional perils of  
windstorm, hail, riot, civil commotion, vehicle and aircraft damage to the insured property, explosion, and smoke  
damage. A VANDALISM AND MALICIOUS MISCHIEF ENDORSEMENT can also be added.  
FIRE LEGAL LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for property loss liability as the result of negligent acts and/or  
omissions of the insured that allows a spreading fire to damage others' property. Negligent acts and omissions can result  
in fire legal liability. For example, an insured through negligence allows a fire to spread to a neighbor's property. The  
neighbor then brings suit against the insured for negligence. In another example, a tenant occupying another party's  
property through negligence causes serious fire damage to the property.  
FIRE LOAD amount of combustible matter present that can act as a fuel to feed a HOSTILE FIRE.  
FIRE MAP detail showing distribution of property coverages written by an insurance company. Illustrates a potential

FIRST-DOLLAR COVERAGE insurance policy under which payment is made for a loss not subject to any  
DEDUCTIBLE or under which payment is made up to the limits of the policy, and then an EXCESS INSURANCE  
policy takes effect. For example, a HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICYSECTION II (LIABILITY COVERAGE)  
would pay up to its limits for an insured loss, whereupon an UMBRELLA LIABILITY INSURANCE policy would go  
into effect.

FIXED-AMOUNT SETTLEMENT OPTION choice of beneficiary in which the death benefit of a life insurance policy  
is retained by the company to be paid as a series of installments of fixed dollar amounts per installment until the death  
benefit and interest are exhausted. Any excess interest earned above the minimum guaranteed is applied to extend the  
time period for making the payments. This option emphasizes dollar amount per installment as opposed to length of  
time installments are to be paid. See also LIFE INSURANCE; OPTIONAL MODES OF SETTLEMENT.  
FIXED ANNUITY see FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY.  
FIXED BENEFITS payment to a beneficiary that does not vary; for example, a fixed monthly retirement income benefit  
of $800 paid to a retired employee.  
FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY ANNUITY that guarantees that a specific sum of money will be paid in the future,  
usually as monthly income, to an annuitant. For example, a $1000-a-month income benefit will be paid as long as the  
annuitant lives; the dollar amount will not fluctuate regardless of adverse changes in the insurance company's mortality  
experience, investment return, and expenses.  
FIXED DOLLAR INVESTMENTS financial instruments whose principal and income are established in advance  
according to contractual terms set forth in the financial instrument's document. Examples of such investments include  
savings accounts, certificates of deposit, ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE, and the ANNUITY.

FIXED INCOME FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT coverage that pays a fixed dollar amount of interest at regular intervals.  
FIXED-PERIOD OPTION SETTLEMENT beneficiary's choice, in a life insurance policy or annuity, for receiving  
income payments for a given period of time. The number of payments are fixed by the payee; the benefit amount is  
determined by the death proceeds. For example, an income benefit of $1000 per month is paid for a period of 48  
months, whereupon all income payments cease.  
FIXED PERIOD PAYOUT income paid for a specified number of years from an ANNUITY.  
FIXED PREMIUM payment for coverage that remains throughout the same premium-paying period.  
FLAT AMOUNT see DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.  
FLAT CANCELLATION cancellation of an insurance policy on the date that policy becomes effective. This type of

benefits offered by the employer. In essence, the employee is provided with the opportunity to make a trade-off by  
trading one benefit for another that best meets the employee's needs at a particular point in time. Contributions paid into  
the plan, whether on a CONTRIBUTORY or NONCONTRIBUTORY basis, can  
< previous page page_191 next page >  
 
< previous page page_192 next page >  
Page 192  
be allocated to satisfy the needs of a particular employee rather than those of the employees as a whole. The result  
should be a balance between the employee's primary needs and the benefit/cost constraints. Among the personal choices  
that the employee can make are health care plans (choices in types and amount of coverages). WELLNESS PROGRAM  
plans, child-care benefits, and LONG-TERM CARE (LTC) PLANS.  
FLEXIBLE ENHANCED ORDINARY LIFE modified ENHANCED ORDINARY LIFE in which there is a  
combination of dividends purchasing PAID-UP ADDITIONS, TERM LIFE INSURANCE, and ORDINARY LIFE  
INSURANCE. The structure of this product is such that a minimum FACE AMOUNT of ordinary life insurance must  
be maintained, but the POLICYOWNER is not limited in the amount of term life insurance that may be added. Since  
the ordinary life and term life product mix can vary, the premium rate per $1000 will also vary. (Life insurance is sold  
in units of $1000 and rated in terms of $1000 units.) There is, however, a minimum rate per $1000 that must be paid. At  
any time after issue, the policyowner may increase or decrease the amount of term life insurance as well as increase or  
decrease the amount of extra premiums paid into the policy. These extra premiums will purchase paid-up additions. See  
also ENHANCED ORDINARY LIFE.  
FLEXIBLE FUNDING arrangement whereby the insured pays the insurance company a relatively small monthly  
premium payment. In exchange for this premium payment, the insurance company processes and pays claims from a  
fund owned and maintained by the insured. Should the claims exceed a stipulated limit, the insurance company pays the  
excess amount of claims.  
FLEXIBLE PORTFOLIO ACCOUNTS accounts in which assets are allocated across the spectrum of equity, debt, and  
money market instruments. They are the most popular equity investment in VARIABLE ANNUITIES and VARIABLE  
LIFE INSURANCE.  
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM one in which the amount and frequency of payment may fluctuate. See also FLEXIBLE  
PREMIUM ANNUITY; FLEXIBLE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE; FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE;  
UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE; UNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM ANNUITY annuity with no fixed schedule for payment of premiums. For example, premiums  
can be paid for 10 straight months, then not paid for the next 10 months, then paid every other month, or any  
combination thereof.  
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM DEFERRED ANNUITY (FPDA) contract sold by an insurance company under which the  
premium payment frequency (monthly, quarterly, semiannually, yearly) may vary and the amount of each premium  
payment (usually subject to a minimum of $100) may vary. This contract pays a monthly (or quarterly, semiannual, or  
annual) income benefit for the life of a person (the ANNUI-  
< previous page page_192 next page >

Page 193  
TANT), for the lives of two or more persons, or for a specified period of time. These income payments are scheduled to  
begin at a specified later date. The annuitant can never outlive the income from the annuity. While the basic purpose of  
life insurance is to provide an income for a beneficiary at the death of the insured, the annuity is intended to provide an  
income for life for the annuitant. See also ANNUITY; CASH REFUND ANNUITY; FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY;  
INSTALLMENT REFUND ANNUITY; JOINT-LIFE AND SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY; JOINT LIFE ANNUITY;  
LIFE ANNUITY CERTAIN; PURE ANNUITY; VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY.  
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE policy that has an initial premium with flexible premiums thereafter.  
Within limits, a policy-owner can select both the future amount and frequency of premiums, or can stop and start  
premium payments at his or her discretion. Lump sum premium payments can be deposited, subject only to federal tax  
code restrictions.  
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE insurance that combines features of FLEXIBLE PREMIUM LIFE  
INSURANCE and UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE into one policy in the following manner:  
1. Premiumsafter the required minimum initial premium payment, premiums are flexible. The policyowner can select  
both their future amount and frequency, with certain restrictions that depend on the design of the policy. The  
policyowner can stop and start the premiums at his or her discretion, and a lump sum premium can be made at any time  
subject only to federal tax restrictions.  
2. Variablethe death benefit may increase or decrease subject to the performance of an investment account of equities in  
which the premiums are placed. However, a minimum death benefit is guaranteedthe initial face value of the policy.  
Cash values fluctuate according to the performance of this investment account.  
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTHEALTH CARE/DEPEN-DENT CARE EXPENSES plan established by the  
employer that permits the employee to defer pretax earnings into a specifically designated account. From this account,  
the employee may withdraw funds to pay unreimbursed medical expenses and/or qualified child-care expenses.  
Generally, there is a cap set by the employer that limits the maximum amount the employee can pay into this account. In  
addition, there is a $5000 limit set by the federal government for the child-care expenses account. Any unused funds  
remaining in this account at year's end are forfeited by the employee.  
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT LIFE INSURANCE account established by the insurance company specifically  
for beneficiaries of a life insurance policy where the beneficiary has the choice of leaving the death benefit on deposit in  
the account earning interest or writing checks on the deposited amount.

for a loan. If the merchandise is damaged or destroyed, the lender is indemnified. The policy is on an ALL RISKS basis.  
FLOW-THROUGH COST (NO LOAD INSURANCE) net cost of insurance with no markup to cover an intermediary's  
profit or expenses. An intermediary, such as a broker, sells an insurance product net; that is, there is no loading for his  
own cost of soliciting business or his profit margin.  
FOLLOWING FORM written form which has precisely the same terms as the other PROPERTY INSURANCE policies  
covering a particular property.

FORFEITURE relinquishment of rights in an insurance policy or pension plan. For example, by withdrawing  
contributions to a pension plan, an employee forfeits future retirement benefits under that plan.  
FORFEITURE OF VESTED BENEFITS relinquishment of rights to benefits when an employee withdraws previous  
contributions to a

plan. An employee who had not withdrawn these contributions would have been entitled to full benefits at normal  
retirement age or to a reduced benefit at early retirement, whether or not he or she is in the service of the employer at  
that time.  
FORGERY BOND see DEPOSITORS FORGERY INSURANCE.  
FORGERY INSURANCE insurance with two types of policies available: DEPOSITORS FORGERY INSURANCE;  
FORGERY AND ALTERATION, FORM B.  
FORM attachment to an insurance policy to complete its coverage. For example, the Standard Fire Policy must have  
certain forms attached for it to provide the coverage desired.

FORM 5500 form that reports the status and activity of retirement plans to the Internal Revenue Service (lRS). The IRS  
uses this form to determine whether a retirement plan is in compliance with all requirements. Form 5500 must be filed  
with the IRS by the last day of the seventh month following the plan's year-end.  
FORTUITOUS EVENT see FORTUITOUS LOSS.  
FORTUITOUS LOSS loss occurring by accident or chance, not by anyone's intention. Insurance policies provide  
coverage against losses that occur only on a chance basis, where the insured cannot control the loss; thus the insured  
should not be able to burn down his or her own home and collect. Insurance is not provided against a certainty such as  
wear and tear. Life insurance will not pay a death benefit if the insured commits suicide within the first two years that  
the policy is in force. Even though death is a certainty, the insured cannot buy a policy with the intention of suicide  
within the first two years.  
FORTY-FIVE YEAR RULE one of three ways vesting must occur in a pension plan under the EMPLOYEE  
RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF  
< previous page page_195 next page >  
 
< previous page page_196 next page >  
Page 196  
1974 (ERISA). An employee is entitled to 50% of his or her benefits after 10 years of employment, or when the total  
years of service (at least 5) and the employee's age equal 45, whichever is the earlier achieved. After that, the employee  
is credited with 10% for each year of service for the next 5 years, whereupon 100% vesting is achieved. Under the TAX  
REFORMACT OF 1986, this vesting rule will no longer be in effect for plan years after December 31, 1988. See also  
VESTING.  
FORWARD COMMITMENT RISK RISK incurred by the insurance company after it makes the commitment to make  
the loan at some future time and the borrower may not accept the loan at that time.  
FORWARD CONTRACT arrangement between the buyer and the seller in which there is a mutual agreement to buy or  
sell a security at a given price at a stipulated future date. These contracts are effected on a private placement or over-thecounter  
basis.  
FPA see FREE OF PARTICULAR AVERAGE (FPA).  
FRACTIONAL PREMIUM annual premium expressed on a proportionate basis such as monthly, quarterly, or  
semiannually.  
FRANCHISE CLAUSE CLAUSE found in a MARINE INSURANCE policy that states that the policy will not pay any  
CLAIMS less than a given amount but will pay claims in excess of that amount. The purpose of this clause is to  
eliminate the costs associated with processing small claims because their costs could easily exceed the actual amount of  
the claim. This is a form of deductible insurance.  
FRANCHISE DEDUCTIBLE stipulation that no claim will be paid until a loss exceeds a flat dollar amount or a given  
percentage of the amount of insurance in force. After the loss exceeds this dollar amount or percentage amount, the  
insurance company pays 100% of the claim loss.  
FRANCHISE INSURANCE (WHOLESALE INSURANCE) coverage for small groups that cannot meet the  
underwriting standards of true group insurance. Even though the franchise insurance covers an entire group, individual  
policies are written on each insured person, each having the right to different coverage than other members. Usually  
sold to employer groups.  
FRATERNAL LIFE INSURANCE group coverage for members of a fraternal association, usually on a nonprofit basis.  
FRAUD dishonest act. Coverage for loss by fraud (not liability for committing fraud) is provided under the various  
bonds and crime insurance policies. See also FIDELITY BOND.  
FRAUD BOND see BOND; BLANKET POSITION BOND; COMMERCIAL BLANKET BOND; CONTRACT  
BOND; FIDELITY BOND; JUDICIAL BOND; NAME SCHEDULE BOND.

Page 197  
FRAUDULENT CLAIM demand without foundation, such as a claim submitted to an insurance company by an insured  
who caused a loss, or for a loss that never occurred.  
FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION dishonest statement to induce an insurance company to write coverage on  
an applicant. If the company knew the truth, it would not accept the applicant. Fraudulent misrepresentation gives a  
property and casualty company grounds to terminate a policy at any time. A life insurance company, on the other hand,  
can terminate a policy on the grounds of fraudulent misrepresentation only during its first two years; after that, the  
INCONTESTABLE CLAUSE takes effect.  
FREE ALONGSIDE SHIP (FAS) term meaning that an exporter of goods that are damaged or destroyed during  
international shipment relinquishes responsibility for the damage or destruction once the goods leave the point of  
origination.  
FREE EXAMINATION "FREE LOOK" PERIOD right, in most states, of an insured to have 10 days in which to  
examine an insurance policy, and if not satisfied, to return it to the company for a full refund of the initial premium.  
FREE LOOK PERIOD see FREE EXAMINATION "FREE LOOK" PERIOD.  
FREE-OF-CAPTURE-AND-SEIZURE CLAUSE exclusion of coverage in marine insurance if damage or destruction  
of property results from war, capture, or seizure.  
FREE OF PARTICULAR AVERAGE (FPA) marine insurance contract clause that limits an insurance company's  
liability. The company agrees to pay only losses that exceed a percentage or flat dollar amount; partial (below this  
percentage or amount) losses are not paid. In essence, the principle is like the DEDUCTIBLE feature of other policies.  
FREE ON BOARD (FOB) term meaning that an exporter of goods that are damaged or destroyed during international  
shipment relinquishes responsibility for the damage or destruction once the goods reach the point of destination.  
FREE TRADE ZONE geographical area in which commerce can be conducted without tariffs being applied. The  
concept was adopted in insurance through the use of a REINSURANCE FACILITY for buying and selling of insurance  
coverages without a premium tax being applied.  
FREEZING OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIABILITY procedure whereby there is no amortization of the employer's liability  
for the supplemental cost of an employee's future benefits to be paid at retirement. See also INDIVIDUAL LEVEL  
COST METHOD WITH SUPPLEMENTAL LIABILITY.  
FREIGHT INSURANCE coverage for goods during shipment on a common carrier. See also CARGO INSURANCE.

FREQUENCY number of times a loss occurs.  
FREQUENCY AND DISTRIBUTION OF LOSSES number of times losses occur, and their severity. These statistics  
measure expectation of loss, and are critical in establishing a basic premium or the pure cost of protection that is based  
on expectation of loss.  
FRIENDLY FIRE kindling intentionally set in a fireplace, stove, furnace, or other containment that has not spread  
beyond it. Property insurance does not protect against damage from a friendly fire. For example, smoke damage to the  
inside of a fireplace is not covered because the fire is in its normal habitat; to insure it would be insuring against a  
certainty. Insurance is designed to provide coverage against the fortuitous loss. See also HOSTILE FIRE.  
FRONT END LOADED TERM see DEPOSIT TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
FRONTING COMPANY see FRONTING.  
FRONTING (FRONTING COMPANY) procedure under which the CEDING COMPANY (the primary or fronting  
company) cedes the risk it has underwritten to its reinsurer with the ceding company retaining none or a very small  
portion of that risk for its own account. See also REINSURANCE.  
FRONT LOADING expenses added to the beginning of a premium payment period. For example, an annuity with a  
10% front load would include $10 of expenses for each $100 premium paid.  
FROZEN KEOGH PLAN plan to which contributions are not being made, but which has not been formally terminated.  
The freezing of a KEOGH PLAN (HR-10) may occur in the following circumstances:  
1. self-employed person stops contributing to the plan.  
2. personal corporation is dissolved and stops contributing to the plan even though the employee of the personal  
corporation may continue in the same occupation.  
3. self-employed person under the original plan may form a partner-ship or incorporate, necessitating the freezing of the  
original plan and the establishment of a new plan.  
Owners of a frozen plan must make sure the plan continues to conform to current regulations and continue to file  
annually FORM 5500. Annual administrative costs may be saved by terminating the frozen plan and rolling over its  
assets into a currently active qualified plan.

FULL-PAID ADDITIONS see DIVIDEND ADDITION.  
FULL PRELIMINARY TERM RESERVE PLAN method of valuing a reserve under which a life insurance policy,  
from an actual point of view, combines one-year term insurance and a one-year deferred plan. Here the net premium is  
sufficient only to pay first-year death claims. For example, a 10-pay life insurance policy issued at age 30 would be  
viewed actuarially, for full preliminary term reserve plan purposes, as one-year term insurance at age 30 plus a nine-pay  
policy issued at age 30 but deferred to age 31.  
FULL PRELIMINARY TERM RESERVE VALUATION mathematical combination of one-year term insurance and  
one-year deferred permanent insurance such that no reserve has to be set up for the first year the policy is in force and  
allowance is made for adjustment in future reserves to reflect this one-year lag.  
FULL REPORTING CLAUSE provision in commercial property coverage under which an insured must report the  
value of an insured property at periodic intervals in order to preserve coverage up to values reported. In essence, this  
clause requires the insured to maintain total insurance to the value of the property, or 100% coinsurance. If the insured  
maintains less than the 100% requirement and a loss takes place, only a portion of that loss will be paid. See also  
COINSURANCE.  
FULL VALUATION RESERVE method of valuing a reserve under which no reserve is established for a life insurance  
policy at the end of the first policy year, but reserves are established at the end of the second policy year. This approach  
enables the company to have more funds available during the first policy year to pay the expenses associated with  
selling the policy. See also FULL PRELIMINARY TERM RESERVE PLAN.  
FULL VALUE LOSS RESERVES undiscounted LOSS RESERVES that must be maintained by property and casualty  
insurance companies in an adequate amount to provide for the payment of the settlement value of the outstanding claims  
of the companies. These reserves cannot be reduced by the expected return from any investment considerations.  
FULL VESTING entitlement to pension benefits without a reduction, even though an employee is no longer in the  
service of an employer at retirement. For example, under the TEN YEAR VESTING rule, an employee who has worked  
10 years for an employer is automatically credited with future retirement benefits. See also VESTING, CONDITIONAL.  
FULLY INSURED STATUS provision in Social Security: to receive retirement monthly income, a participant must  
have earned income on which Social Security taxes were paid for at least 10 years or 40 quarters.  
< previous page page_199 next page >

Page 200  
FULLY PAID POLICY limited pay whole life policy under which all premium payments have been made. For  
example, a 20 pay policy is completely paid for after 20 payments; no future premiums have to be made, and the policy  
remains in full force for the life of the insured.  
FUNDAMENTAL basic requirements of an employee benefit insurance plan such as minimum age and years of service  
with an employer.  
FUNDED COVER transaction in which the CEDING COMPANY pays a premium and is guaranteed certain future  
payments to fund future losses. If losses are less than was expected, the ceding company receives a profit commission.  
Conversely, if catastrophic losses are occurring at a faster rate than the investment return earned on the premium, the  
ceding company will not receive its full recovery on its reinsurance. See also FINANCIAL REINSURANCE.  
FUNDED PENSION PLAN plan in which funds are currently allocated to purchase retirement benefits. An employee is  
thus assured of receiving retirement payments, even if the employer is no longer in business at the time the employee  
retires. See also ALLOCATED FUNDING INSTRUMENT.  
FUNDED RETIREMENT PLAN see FUNDED PENSION PLAN.  
FUNDED TRUST see LIFE INSURANCE TRUST.  
FUNDING allocation of funds in a retirement plan. See also ALLOCATED FUNDING INSTRUMENT.

for the purpose of paying accrued pension benefits. See also ACCRUED BENEFIT COST METHOD; PENSION  
PLAN FUNDING, GROUP DEPOSIT ADMINISTRATION ANNUITY; PENSION PLAN FUNDING, GROUP  
IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATING GUARANTEE (IPG) CONTRACT ANNUITY; PENSION PLAN FUNDING,  
GROUP PERMANENT CONTRACT; PENSION PLAN FUNDING, INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT PENSION PLAN.  
FUNDING AGREEMENT private placement investment contract sold by insurance companies. This product has no  
registration requirement and pays the investor a higher rate of return than commercial paper. Frequently associated with  
this product are PUT OPTIONS that permit the investor to terminate the contract provided 7, 30, 90, or 180 days'  
notification is given.  
FUNDING COVER refers to the insured or reinsured paying premiums into an account at a commercial bank that will  
be used to pay for future or past losses. Portions of the premiums not required to pay for these losses are refunded to the  
POLICYOWNER or CEDING COMPANY.  
FUNDING INSTRUMENT/FUNDING MEDIA/FUNDING VEHICLE legal contract, such as an insurance policy,  
annuity or pension plan, containing ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT considerations for the proper

Page 201  
rate structure so that premium payments will be adequate to provide for future benefit payments.  
FUNDING STANDARD ACCOUNT approach in pension plan funding under which a separate account is maintained  
for comparing actual contributions to the plan with the minimum contributions required to meet future employee benefit  
liabilities. This account acts as a reservoir in that it can store excess contributions above the minimum required. It also  
allows excess contributions to accumulate at interest and then applies these accrued contributions to reduce the  
minimum required future contributions.  
FUNDS PAID IN ADVANCE TO COVER EXPENSES see RAIN INSURANCE.  
FUNERAL INSURANCE modest life insurance coverage to pay burial expenses upon the death of an insured.  
FUR AND JEWELRY FLOATER coverage on an ALL RISKS basis for loss or damage to fur and jewelry at any  
location. Furs and jewelry must be scheduled in order to be covered.  
FURRIER'S BLOCK INSURANCE coverage for furs owned by a furrier, or a customer's furs in the care, custody, and  
control of the furrier. Coverage is on an ALL RISKS basis except those specifically excluded: wear and tear; war;  
delay; loss of market; flood; earthquake; loss or damage while furs are being worn by the insured or his or her  
representatives; loss resulting from infidelity of any person under the care, custody, and control of the insured; damage  
or destruction of the furs after they leave the care, custody, and control of the insured that has been sold under an  
installment contract; and mysterious disappearance.  
FURRIERS CUSTOMERS POLICY coverage on an ALL RISKS basis for fur garments belonging to customers of a  
furrier. See also FURRIERS BLOCK INSURANCE.  
FURS INSURANCE coverage on fur coats as well as other clothes that have fur trim. Protection is provided at any  
location on an ALL RISKS basis subject to the exclusions of wear and tear, war, and nuclear disaster. Each item must  
be specifically listed in the policy.  
FUTURE BUY-OUT EXPENSE OPTION option clause in a DISABILITY BUY-OUT INSURANCE POLICY that  
permits the owner of the policy to increase the limits of coverage for the expenses associated with the buy-out process.  
Usually, the limits can be increased only on the dates stipulated in this option clause.  
FUTURE INSURABILITY GUARANTEE/FUTURE INCREASE OPTION option clause in a DISABILITY INCOME  
POLICY that the insured can exercise that would permit the insured the right to purchase additional limits of coverage  
regardless of the insured's physical condition. These additional purchases are limited by the insured's age and a  
< previous page page_201 next page >  
 
< previous page page_202 next page >  
Page 202  
maximum dollar amount, as well as twice the total monthly disability income from all insurance companies that the  
insured has in force, at which time the lesser of these two amounts would apply. This option may be exercised by the  
insured annually, usually until age 55.  
FUTURES CONTRACTS DERIVATIVE representing a legal obligation to carry out a transaction that has been  
prearranged according to a stipulated price and date in the future. There are numerous types of financial instruments  
through which the value of this obligation may be established to include commodities, currencies, market indexes,  
interest rates, stocks, and bonds.  
FUTURE SERVICE BENEFITS retirement payments to be credited for future years of service with an employer.  
FUTURES TIED TO REINSURANCE futures contracts based on automobile and health REINSURANCE policies to  
be traded on the Commodity Future Exchange of the Chicago Board of Trade. The purpose is to allow insurance  
companies in the United States and abroad to use these futures contracts to hedge against losses on automobile and  
health policies that the companies underwrite. At the expiration point of the 3-month-long futures contract, certificates  
of reinsurance (showing evidence of the existence and terms of a particular policy or policies) are issued to the  
remaining contract holders. After all the claims have been paid, the reinsurance certificates are redeemed for an amount  
equal to the net earned premium. See also AUTOMATIC NONPROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE; AUTOMATIC

GAMBLING RISK-creating device as compared with INSURANCE, which is a risk-reducing or -eliminating device.  
This is a form of speculative risk.  
GAMBLING INSURANCE see WAGERING AND INSURANCE.  
GARAGE INSURANCE coverage for bodily injury, property damage or destruction, for which the insured garage and/  
or its representatives become legally liable resulting from the operation of the garage. For example, negligent repair to a  
customer's automobile brakes cause them to fail, thereby injuring the driver. The garage faces a liability suit for perhaps  
three types of damages: special, general, and punitive.  
GENERAL ACCOUNT GUARANTEED INVESTMENTS CONTRACT (GIC) type of GUARANTEED  
INVESTMENTS CONTRACT in which funds for the contract are put in the insurance company's general account.  
GENERAL ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (GAB) national agency supported by property insurance companies. The bureau  
is used by companies that do not have their own claims adjusters.  
GENERAL AGENCY SYSTEM means of distribution that uses general agents rather than branch offices to sell life and  
health insurance. See also GENERAL AGENT (GA).  
GENERAL AGENT (GA) individual responsible for insurance agency operation in a particular area, including sale of  
life and health insurance, servicing policies already sold, recruiting and training agents, and providing administrative  
support. General agents are compensated on a commission basis and usually pay all expenses of administering their  
agencies.  
GENERAL AGENTS AND MANAGERS CONFERENCE (GAMC) association of general agents and managers  
affiliated with the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR LIFE UNDERWRITING (NALU). Their objective is to seek  
solutions to common managerial problems. GAMC provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and gives awards for  
outstanding performance by members.  
GENERAL AVERAGE expenses and damages incurred as the result of damage to a ship and its cargo and/or of taking  
direct action to prevent initial or further damage to the ship and its cargo. These expenses and damages are paid by  
those with an interest in the ship and its cargo in proportion to their values exposed to the common danger. Contrast  
with PARTICULAR AVERAGE.  
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS attributes of a particular employee benefit plan. For example, a general characteristic  
of group life insurance is that the whole group is underwritten, not individual members.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS see GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS.  
GENERAL DAMAGES see LIABILITY, CIVIL DAMAGES AWARDED.  
GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for an insured when negligent acts and/or omissions result in bodily  
injury and/or property damage on the premises of a business, when someone is injured as the result of using the product  
manufactured or distributed by a business, or when someone is injured in the general operation of a business.  
GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) type of accounting method, in life insurance,  
designed to match revenues and expenses of an insurer according to principles designed by the Financial Accounting  
Standards Board and the Audit Guide for Stock Life Insurance Companies published by the American Institute of CPAs.  
For example, under GAAP, acquisition expenses (costs of placing insurance on a company's books such as  
administrative expenses and agent commissions) are recognized in the same proportion that premium income is  
recognized over the premium paying period, with losses subtracted from premium and investment income as they occur.  
GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSE costs incurred by an insurance company other than agent commissions and taxes;  
that is, mainly the administrative expense of running a company.  
GENERAL PROPERTY FORM attachment to a property business insurance policy providing coverage for a business  
structure and any additions and/or extensions; merchandise and other stock and inventory within the structure (not  
including animals, pets, watercraft, out-door trees, shrubs, and plants, outdoor signs, fences, and swimming pools);  
personal property of the insured while in the insured structure and within 100 feet of the premises; and personal  
property of a third party under the safekeeping of the insured in the insured structure and within 100 feet of the  
premises. The General Property Form Provides coverage in three ways:  
1. Specifican amount of insurance is provided on a specified piece of property.  
2. Schedulean amount of insurance is provided on several specified pieces of property listed in the policy.  
3. Blanketan amount of insurance is provided on several different kinds of property, several different locations, or a  
combination of several different kinds of property at several different locations.  
GENERATION SKIPPING TRANSFER TAXES provision under the Internal Revenue Code, Chapter 13, that specifies  
a transfer tax of 55% of the gift to a person at least two generations younger than the transferor (person who gives the  
gift). This tax is imposed in addition to any estate taxes or regular gift taxes.

GIFT transfer of property without payment.  
GIFT IN TRUST value or property given by an individual to a trustee who holds and administers it for the benefit of the  
donee (recipient of the gift). For example, a father entrusts a life insurance policy with all ownership rights to a trustee.  
The trustee owns the policy, collects the proceeds, and administers the proceeds for the benefit of the donee son. See  
also ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION.  
GIFT OUTRIGHT value or property given by an individual directly to a donee (recipient of the gift), for example, when  
a father gives a life insurance policy with all ownership rights to his son. See also ESTATE PLANNING  
DISTRIBUTION.  
GIFT TAX tax, under federal and state laws, on transfer of property made without payment or other value in exchange.  
GIFT TAX EXCLUSION amount, not in excess of $10,000 per year, given to each of an unlimited number of donees  
free of FEDERAL ESTATE TAX and GIFT TAX. Each individual can give up to $10,000 to any one donee, or up to  
$10,000 each to an unlimited number of donees, provided the gift has no conditions attached. A gift completed in this  
manner will not reduce the donor's MARITAL DEDUCTION.  
Wealth can be transferred on a significant basis free from federal estate tax by careful planning providing the donor is  
comfortable giving away acquired wealth while still alive. A word of caution: If the gift is in the form of a check, the  
Internal Revenue requires that the check be paid and cleared by the donor's bank before the gift can be considered  
complete. Thus, if the check is given in December, but does not clear the donor's bank until January, the gift would be  
deemed to have been given in the new year and the old year's gift allowance will have been wasted.  
G.I. INSURANCE see GOVERNMENT LIFE INSURANCE.  
GLASS INSURANCE see COMPREHENSIVE GLASS INSURANCE.  
GLASS-STEAGALL ACT (BANKING ACT OF 1933) legislation excluding commercial banks that are members of  
the Federal Reserve System from most types of investment banking activities. The coauthor of the Act, Senator Carter  
Glass of Virginia, believed that commercial banks should restrict their activities to involvement in short-term loans to  
coincide with the nature of their primary classification of liabilities, demand deposits. Today, many in the banking field  
view these constraints as particularly burdensome because of increased competition from other financial institutions for  
customers' savings and investment dollars.  
GOLFERS EQUIPMENT INSURANCE coverage for golf clubs and golf equipment on an ALL RISKS basis subject to  
exclusions of wear and tear, war, and nuclear disaster. Location of coverage is a clubhouse locker or any other building  
used in golf activities. For example, if a golfer's clubs were in the locker in the clubhouse and they were stolen,  
< previous page page_205 next page >

Page 206  
the golfer would be indemnified. There is usually no coinsurance requirement, and coverage is provided on a  
replacement cost basis.  
GOOD SAMARITAN COVERAGE see HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICYSECTION II (LIABILITY  
COVERAGE).  
GOOD STUDENT DISCOUNT reduction in automobile insurance rate for a student with a good academic record.  
Some statistical studies suggest that good students have fewer automobile accidents.  
GOODWILL monetary value of the reputation of a business. Goodwill is an intangible asset and thus may be difficult to  
measure.  
GOVERNMENT INSURANCE coverage under the auspices of a federal or state agency that can be either mandatory or  
elective. See also SOCIAL INSURANCE.  
GOVERNMENT LIFE INSURANCE coverage for present and past U.S. uniformed services members under one of  
these programs:  
1. United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)established in 1919 to provide RENEWABLE TERM LIFE  
INSURANCE up to $10,000. This program is no longer available.  
2. National Service Life Insurance (NSLI)established in 1940 to take the place of USGLI; terminated in 1950. Today  
NSLI exists for amounts ranging from $1000 to $10,000 under five-year renewable term and permanent forms of life  
insurance. The latter policies have the same nonforfeiture benefits and OPTIONAL MODES OF SETTLEMENT as  
COMMERCIAL FORMS of life insurance.  
3. SERVICEMEN'S GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (SGLI)established in 1965 to cover active members of the U.S.  
uniformed forces; purchased through commercial insurance companies on a group basis at a government subsidized  
rate. Each service person pays a premium that reflects nonmilitary mortality expectation and administrative expenses.  
The federal government subsidizes the premium by paying for any extra mortality and administrative expenses  
associated with the military exposure. Upon discharge, a SGLI policy can be converted, regardless of physical  
condition, to a five-year nonrenewable Veterans Group Life Policy (VGLI), and then can be converted (after five years)  
again regardless of healthto an individual life policy with any of the participating commercial life insurance companies.  
4. VETERANS GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (VGLI)nonrenewable convertible five-year term insurance to which SGLI  
is converted at the time a service person is discharged. It has no cash or loan value, disability benefits, paid-up benefits,  
or extended term benefits. It can be converted to an individual policy with a participating company.  
GOVERNMENT MONEY MUTUAL FUNDS investments made in a variety of securities issued by government

GRACE PERIOD period after the date the premium is due during which the premium can be paid with no interest  
charged, the policy remaining in force. This period is for 30 or 31 days. If the insured dies during this period, the  
beneficiary would receive the full face amount of the policy minus the premium owed. Thus the use of the grace period  
allows the financial technique of leveraging.  
GRADED see GRADED COMMISSION; GRADED DEATH BENEFIT; GRADED PREMIUM, WHOLE LIFE  
INSURANCE.  
GRADED COMMISSION compensation that varies with the class and type of insurance sold. Many insurance  
companies offer varying commissions according to the volume of business an agent places with the company.  
GRADED DEATH BENEFIT death payment that increases with the age of an insured. Graded benefits may increase  
gradually and then level off, or may increase sharply before becoming level. This type of coverage is most common in  
juvenile life insurance.  
GRADED POLICY insurance for which premiums are charged according to the size of the FACE AMOUNT of the  
policy, so that the greater the face amount, the lower the cost per $1000 unit of insurance.  
GRADED PREMIUM, WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE coverage under which initial premiums are less than normal for  
the first few years, then gradually increase for the next several years until they become level for the duration of the  
policy.  
GRADED VESTING VESTING, DEFERRED or VESTING, IMMEDIATE under which the accrued benefits of the  
employee increase on a percentage basis (according to years of service and/or attained age) until 100% VESTING is  
achieved.  
GRADUATED LIFE TABLE MORTALITY TABLE that reflects irregularities from age to age due to chance  
fluctuations in the sequence of the rates of mortality. The rates of death as reflected by the mortality table in its most  
idealized form (the ''perfect world" approach) should proceed smoothly from age bracket to subsequent age bracket.  
Irregularities may result from:  
1. statistical fluctuations due to an insufficiently large data base.  
2. use of statistics that are not homogeneous.  
3. statistics of one particular mortality study not representing other mortality studies.  
4. mortality statistics for later policy years too scanty to yield reliable information, and too heavily weighted towards the  
earlier policy years.  
GRADUATED MORTALITY TABLE see GRADUATED LIFE TABLE.

GRANT OF LIMITED PROPERTY INTEREST see ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION.  
GRANTOR individual who creates a TRUST and generally places his or her assets in it.  
GRANTOR RETAINED ANNUITY TRUST (GRAT) irrevocable TRUST into which the GRANTOR places assets and  
receives in turn a fixed amount of income from a fixed ANNUITY (amount of income stipulated at the time the trust is  
established) for either a given number of years, or for the lesser of a given number of years, or until the grantor's death.  
When the term of the trust expires, assets in the trust to include any appreciation are distributed to the named remainder  
beneficiary(s). If the assets in the trust fail to generate sufficient income to make the required annuity payments, the  
principal of the asset on deposit in the trust must be liquidated in an amount needed to meet the required income  
payments. This principal could diminish dramatically by the time it is transferred to the remainder beneficiary(s). If the  
grantor is alive when the trust terminates, the assets and their appreciation within the trust are not included in the  
grantor's estate.  
GRANTOR-RETAINED INCOME TRUST (GRIT) irrevocable TRUST into which the GRANTOR places assets and  
retains the income from or the use of these assets for a stipulated period of time. At the termination of this time period,  
the principal (assets) of the trust is transferred to the grantor's noncharitable BENEFICIARY. The noncharitable  
beneficiary may include individual(s) such as a grandchild, niece, nephew, son, or daughter. Should the grantor survive  
the stipulated period of time, he or she will incur substantial savings in estate and gift taxes. In order for these savings in  
taxes to occur, the following requirements must be met by the grantor:  
1. income to the grantor must be the sole result of the income generated by assets held in the trust.  
2. any income generated by the assets held in the trust can be paid only to the grantor of the trust.  
3. neither the grantor nor the spouse of the grantor can act as a trustee of the trust.  
4. any income retained by the grantor must be for a period of time not to exceed 10 years.  
Should the grantor die before the stipulated period of time the trust expires, the value of the assets of the trust are  
included in the grantor's estate for FEDERAL ESTATE TAX purposes, even though the assets are not physically  
transferred to the estate of the grantor. See also SUPERGRIT.  
GRANTOR RETAINED TRUST TRUST under which grantor retains income from the ASSETS that have been  
transferred to the trust. This  
< previous page page_208 next page >

trust permits the avoidance of probate, protects the assets from creditors, and leads to the savings of substantial taxes.  
See also GRANTOR-RETAINED INCOME TRUST (GRIT); SUPERGRIT.  
GRANTOR RETAINED UNITRUST (GRUT) irrevocable TRUST into which the GRANTOR places assets and  
receives in turn a variable amount of income from a VARIABLE ANNUITY (amount of income will vary yearly  
depending upon the increase or decrease in the value of the assets on deposit in the trust) for either a given number of  
years, or for the lesser of a given number of years, or until the grantor's death. When the term of the trust expires, assets  
in the trust to include any appreciation are distributed to the named remainder beneficiary(s). If the grantor is alive when  
the trust terminates, the assets and their appreciation within the trust are not included in the grantor's estate.  
GROSS see GROSS EARNINGS FORM; GROSS INCOME; GROSS PREMIUM.  
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) measurement of the nominal value of all goods and services produced in a one  
year period. This production includes that by United States-owned companies as well as by production plants located in  
the United States and owned by foreign companies. As GDP increases, there is a tendency for company profits and  
interest rates to rise as well. Conversely, as GDP decreases, there is a tendency for company profits and interest rates to  
also decline. These figures are published on a quarterly basis by the United States Department of Commerce.  
GROSS EARNINGS FORM coverage for loss in the gross earnings of the business (minus expenses that cease while  
the business is inoperative) as the result of the interruption of normal business activities caused by damage to the  
premises by an insured peril. Noncontinuing expenses include light, gas, and advertising for which there is no  
contractual obligation. Coverage can be obtained on either a 50, 60, 70, or 80% coinsurance basis. Selection of the  
coinsurance percentage is dependent upon the length of time business is expected not to operate in the worst of  
circumstances.  
GROSS ESTATE sum total of all assets owned by the decedent to include personal property, real property, and trust  
property.  
GROSS INCOME total income before adjustment for deduction as applied to tax calculation for both the individual and  
the firm.  
GROSS LINE total limit on the amount of coverage an INSURER will underwrite on an individual RISK. The amount  
underwritten includes the amount to be CEDED through a REINSURANCE agreement.  
GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT (GNP) total value of all goods and services produced by companies located in the  
United States as well as that produced by United States companies whose production facilities are outside the United  
States.

GROSS NEGLIGENCE reckless action without regard to life, limb, and/or property; for example, driving 100 miles per  
hour on a road or highway.  
GROSS PREMIUM  
General: net premium, plus operating and miscellaneous expenses, and agent's commissions.  
Life insurance: premium before dividends are subtracted.  
GROUP ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE see GROUP DISABILITY INSURANCE; GROUP HEALTH  
INSURANCE; GROUP INSURANCE.  
GROUP ANNUITY contract providing a monthly income benefit to members of a group of employees. A group  
annuity has the same characteristics as an individual annuity, except that it is underwritten on a group basis. See also  
ANNUITY.  
GROUP ANNUITY TABLE, 1951 first historical MORTALITY TABLE used for the calculation of PREMIUM rates  
for GROUP ANNUITIES. This table was subsequently replaced by the GROUP ANNUITY TABLE, 1971.  
GROUP ANNUITY TABLE, 1971 historical MORTALITY TABLE that replaced the GROUP ANNUITY TABLE,  
1951, whose statistics at that time were more current than the replaced table. This table was subsequently replaced by  
the 1983 GAM table (mortality table used to calculate male annuity rates on a group basis).  
GROUP CERTIFICATE summary certificate of benefits issued to an employee in lieu of a policy. The master contract  
remains with the employer. For example, in group life insurance, an employee receives only a summary certificate of  
benefits, while the master contract remains with the employer.  
GROUP CONTRACT see GROUP INSURANCE.  
GROUP CREDIT INSURANCE coverage issued to a creditor on the lives of debtors for outstanding loans. If a debtor  
dies before repayment, the policy pays the remainder of the loan to the creditor. The contract covers an entire group of  
debtors rather than each debtor separately.  
GROUP CREDITOR INSURANCE see CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE (CREDITOR LIFE INSURANCE); GROUP  
CREDIT INSURANCE.  
GROUP DEFERRED ANNUITY contract for retirements benefits in which an entire group of employees is  
underwritten, as opposed to a single annuity for each employee. Each premium pays for an increment of a paid-up  
annuity; thus a group deferred annuity is a series of single premium paid-up annuities. It may be considered an  
ALLOCATED FUNDING INSTRUMENT for purchasing retirement benefits. Single premium paid-up annuities that  
have already been purchased guarantee that an employee will receive retirement income whether or not the employer  
remains in business at the time he or she retires.

GROUP DEPOSIT ADMINISTRATION ANNUITY see PENSION PLAN FUNDING.  
GROUP DISABILITY INSURANCE coverage of an employee group whose members receive a monthly disability  
income benefit, subject to a maximum amount, if illness or accident prevents a member from performing the normal  
functions of his or her job. Benefits are usually limited to a stated length of time, and the maximum monthly income  
benefit is usually no more than 50-60% of earnings prior to the disability, or a flat dollar amount, whichever is less.  
GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE coverage underwritten on members of a natural group, such as employees of a  
particular business, union, association, or employer group. Each employee is entitled to benefits for hospital room and  
board, surgeon and physician fees, and miscellaneous medical expenses. There is a DEDUCTIBLE and a  
COINSURANCE requirement each employee must pay. Characteristics of group health insurance include:  
1. TRUE GROUP PLANone in which all employees must be accepted for coverage regardless of physical condition.  
(For example, coverage cannot be denied because of a pre-existing condition such as cancer.) Usually an employee must  
apply and pay the first premium within the first 30 days of employment or he or she forfeits the right to automatic  
coverage (a form of GUARANTEED INSURABILITY). Individuals are covered under a MASTER CONTRACT, each  
receiving a certificate denoting coverage.  
2. Schedule of Benefitsdescribes what the insured and his or her covered dependent(s) is entitled to in the event of  
disease, illness, or injury. After the insured or the covered dependent has satisfied the DEDUCTIBLE (defined as the  
first portion of all of the eligible expenses that occur during a calendar year of coverage), the insurance company pays a  
given percentage (usually 80%) until a total sum (stop loss), usually $5000, is reached for the calendar year. After the  
total sum has been reached, the insurance company pays 100% of the total eligible expenses until the end of the  
calendar year subject to a maximum lifetime amount. See also DEPENDENT.  
3. Eligible Expensesinclude hospital bills, surgery, doctor's services, private nursing, medicines, and X-rays. Payment  
allowed for these and other expenses are spelled out in the policy. For example, the hospital's daily charge for room and  
board is subject to a specified maximum.  
4. Exclusions from Provisions of Medical Benefitsmany exclusions occur in group health plans, including benefits under  
Workers Compensation; certain mouth conditions; convalescent or rest cures; expenses incurred by a member of a  
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) or other prepaid medical plan; expenses associated with  
intentional self-inflicted injuries or attempt at suicide.  
5. COORDINATION OF BENEFITSwhen there are two or more group health insurance plans covering the insured, one  
plan becomes the Primary Plan and the other plan(s) becomes the Secondary Plan(s).  
< previous page page_211 next page >  
 
< previous page page_212 next page >  
Page 212  
The Primary Plan is required to pay benefits due the insured and/or covered dependents before any other plan pays  
benefits. When a claim is made, the primary plan must pay the claim without regard to the benefits provided under any  
other plan. The secondary plan pays the difference between the total claim amount and the amount that the primary plan  
has paid, up to total allowable expenses.  
GROUP IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION GUARANTEED ANNUITY see PENSION PLAN FUNDING; GROUP  
IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION GUARANTEED (IPG) CONTRACT ANNUITY.  
GROUP INSURANCE single policy under which individuals in a natural group (such as employees of a business firm)  
and their dependents are covered. See also GROUP ANNUITY; GROUP CERTIFICATE; GROUP CREDIT  
INSURANCE; GROUP DEFERRED ANNUITY; GROUP DISABILITY INSURANCE; GROUP HEALTH  
INSURANCE; GROUP LIFE INSURANCE; GROUP PAID-UP LIFE INSURANCE; GROUP PERMANENT LIFE  
INSURANCE; GROUP TERM LIFE INSURANCE; PENSION PLAN FUNDING; GROUP DEPOSIT  
ADMINISTRATION ANNUITY.  
GROUP LIFE INSURANCE basic employee benefit under which an employer buys a master policy and issues  
certificates to employees denoting participation in the plan. Group life is also available through unions and associations.  
It is usually issued as yearly renewable term insurance, although some plans provide permanent insurance. Employers  
may pay all the cost or share it with employees. Characteristics include:  
1. Group Underwritingan entire group of employees is underwritten, unlike individual life insurance whereunder only  
the individual is underwritten.  
2. Guaranteed Issueevery employee must be accepted; an employee cannot be denied coverage because of a preexisting  
illness, sickness, or injury.  
3. Conversion at Termination of Employmentregardless of whether termination is because of severance, disability, or  
retirement, the employee has the automatic right to convert to an individual life policy without evidence of insurability  
or taking a physical examination. Conversion must be within 30 days of termination. The premium upon conversion is  
based on the employee's age at the time (ATTAINED AGE).  
4. DISABILITY BENEFITavailable in many policies to an employee less than 60 years of age who can no longer work  
because of the disability. The benefit takes the form of waiver of premium, and the employee is covered for as long as  
the disability continues. The beneficiary will receive the death benefit even though the employee may not have been in  
the service of the employer for a long time.  
5. DEATH BENEFIT Structure or Scheduleis usually based on an employee's earnings. The benefit is a multiple of the  
employee's earnings, normally 1 to 2 1/2 times the employee's yearly earnings.  
< previous page page_212 next page >  
 
< previous page page_213 next page >  
Page 213  
In many companies, if the employee dies while on company business, 6 times the yearly earnings are paid as a death  
benefit. For example, a $50,000 a year employee dies in an accident while traveling on company time; the beneficiary  
would receive $300,000. But if the same employee dies in his sleep at home, the beneficiary would receive $100,000  
(assuming that the normal death benefit is twice annual earnings).  
GROUP LONG-TERM DISABILITY POLICY group insurance contract under which a periodic (usually monthly)  
disability income benefit is paid to the insured as long as he or she remains disabled.  
GROUP OF COMPANIES see FLEET OF COMPANIES.  
GROUP ORDINARY INSURANCE see GROUP PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE.  
GROUP PAID-UP LIFE INSURANCE combination of two basic plans: (1) accumulating units of paid-up permanent  
life insurance, and (2) decreasing units of group term life insurance. The premium paid each month consists of the (a)  
employee's contribution and (b) employer's contribution. The employee's portion purchases increments of paid-up  
insurance, and the employer's portion purchases group decreasing term. The employer's contribution is tax deductible as  
a business expense, and these contributions are not taxable income to the employee. (However, if the employer  
purchases increments of paid-up units of permanent insurance, these contributions are taxable income to the employee  
on a current basis.) Paid-up units purchased by an employee are vested and thus can be taken as a paid-up life benefit  
regardless of the reason for termination of employment. The paid-up benefit will always remain in force; no further  
premium payments are required.  
GROUP PERMANENT see GROUP PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE.  
GROUP PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE coverage following the same structure as group term, the significant  
difference being that premiums go toward the purchase of permanent insurance instead of term insurance. The employee  
has a vested interest in the increments of paid-up insurance purchased. Because of the tax consequences to the  
employee, group permanent insurance usually is applied to fund retirement plans such as pensions instead of providing  
life insurance coverage. If the employer purchased permanent insurance on the employee's behalf, the contributions  
would become taxable income to the employee on a current basis. Group life insurance is experience rated, in that the  
loss experience of the entire group determines the premium rate applied to each employee.  
GROUP PRACTICE HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) HEALTH MAINTENANCE  
ORGANIZATION that restricts to a relatively small amount the number of medical providers from which  
< previous page page_213 next page >  
 
< previous page page_214 next page >  
Page 214  
an HMO member may seek services. Usually, HMO members may select the primary care physician of their choice  
from this number. After rendering services to the HMO member, the physician charges the HMO a predetermined fee.  
Frequently, this select group of medical providers are exclusively in the employment of this particular HMO.  
GROUP TERM LIFE INSURANCE one-year coverage that is renewable at the end of each year. Since the group plan  
is subject to EXPERIENCE RATING, the premium rate upon renewal is based on such factors as the loss record (death)  
of the group and range of employee ages. All employees are insured with term life insurance. Realistically, coverage is  
temporary because on termination of employment, the employee usually does not convert group term to individual  
permanent insurance because the conversion is at a higher attained age rate. See also ATTAINED AGE.  
GROUP UNDERWRITING process of forming a large group of homogeneous lives that in order to allow the LAW OF  
LARGE NUMBERS to operate, thereby projecting a probable rate of mortality or morbidity whose creditability  
approaches one, and standard deviation approaches zero. Since no evidence of insurability has to be submitted on an  
individual basis, the objective of this type of UNDERWRITING is to minimize ADVERSE SELECTION by any  
member of that group. In an effort to achieve this minimization, certain underwriting rules apply: (1) the group must be  
formed for reasons other than obtaining insurance, or people who have a particular disease would join together for the  
sole purpose of buying insurance; (2) a constant flow of young people into the group and outflow of older people out of  
the group is required so that, statistically, the average person (standard health) will continue to be insured; (3) the  
insurance benefits should automatically be determined by some type of formula on behalf of the members, or only those  
members who are in poor health would select the higher limits of coverage; and (4) close to total participation of all  
eligible employees should be achieved.  
GROUP UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE policy similar to that of an individual UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE  
policy except that the coverage is provided (up to a limit) without the requirement of the submission of EVIDENCE OF  
INSURABILITY.  
GROWTH OF ASSETS rate of increase in asset value.  
GUARANTEE COST NONPARTICIPATING LIFE INSURANCE policy whose premiums, cash value, and face  
amount are guaranteed (all values are fixed and do not fluctuate according to the loss experience, expenses, and  
investment returns of the insurance company). The advantage of this policy to the POLICYOWNER is that, when the  
company experiences adverse conditions, they are not passed on to the policy-owner. Likewise, the disadvantage of this  
policy to the policyowner is  
< previous page page_214 next page >  
 
< previous page page_215 next page >  
Page 215  
that the policyowner does not reap the benefits when the company experiences good conditions.  
GUARANTEED COST PREMIUM premium charged for an insurance policy whose coverage does not vary according  
to the insured loss experience. The premium is calculated either on a specified rating basis or on a prospective basis  
(fixed or adjustable).  
GUARANTEED COST (TRADITIONAL) INSURANCE PROGRAM arrangement under which the insured pays a  
fixed premium to the insurance company in exchange for the total transfer of the risk to that company.  
GUARANTEED INSURABILITY right of an insured to make additional purchases of life insurance without having to  
take a physical examination or show other evidence of insurability. Additions can be bought (1) at stated times; (2) upon  
specified policy anniversaries such as every fifth year of a policy up to a maximum age (usually 40 or 45); or (3) upon  
the birth of a child. Many young families should consider adding this option, since a likely time to add to a life  
insurance portfolio is when family obligations increase. See also RIDERS, LIFE POLICIES.  
GUARANTEED INTEREST RATE see INTEREST RATES, GUARANTEED/EXCESS.  
GUARANTEED INTEREST RATE FIXED ACCOUNT account in which a predetermined interest rate is paid for a  
predetermined period of time. For each contribution that is paid into the fixed account, a new guarantee period begins  
for that particular contribution.  
GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACT (GIC) institutional investment sold by life insurance companies that  
guarantees principal and offers withdrawal flexibility. This conservative investment, which can be used with a corporate  
qualified plan, became one of the most popular choices in such salary reduction plans as the 401 (k) plan. Many of  
these plans offered employees three choices for depositing their pre-tax retirement dollars: a stock fund, a bond fund,  
and a GIC. By 1987, about 40% of employees had elected GIC investments.  
GUARANTEED INVESTMENT POLICY see GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACT (GIC).  
GUARANTEED ISSUE the right to purchase insurance without physical examination; the present and past physical  
condition of the applicant are not considered.  
GUARANTEED PURCHASE OPTION see GUARANTEED INSURABILITY.  
GUARANTEED RENEWABLE CONTRACT (LIFE OR HEALTH) insurance policy renewable at the option of the  
insured for a specified number of years or to a stated age. The insurance company cannot refuse to renew the policy and  
cannot change any of its provisions except the PREMIUM RATE. If the insurance company changes the premium, it  
must

GUARANTOR term in surety coverage. Through the issue of a surety bond, a surety company is in effect the guarantor.  
See also SURETY BOND.  
GUARANTY FUND (INSOLVENCY FUND) aggregate sums, in certain states, to pay claims of insolvent insurance  
companies. These funds are maintained by contributions of companies operating in a particular state in proportion to  
their business written in the state. A guaranty fund insures the integrity of the insurance business.  
GUARDIAN individual who is legally responsible for taking care of another individual(s) who is deemed to be  
incapable of managing his/her own affairs. For example, children under the age of majority are not assumed to be able  
to manage their own affairs.  
GUERTIN LAWS standard State Valuation and Nonforfeiture Law approved by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) in 1942. This law is named for Alfred N. Guertin, the actuary who headed  
the NAIC committee that studied the need for a new mortality table to be used in calculating life insurance nonforfeiture  
values. In essence, application of this law guarantees that an insured is entitled to all benefits for which the life  
insurance company has received premiums. The insured cannot be made to forfeit the equity that has built up in a life  
insurance product. See also NONFORFEITURE BENEFITS (OPTION).  
GUEST LAW legal right of a passenger in an automobile involved in an accident to bring a liability suit against the  
driver. It is deemed that a special standard of care is owed by an automobile driver towards the passenger. This law bars  
suits only for ordinarynot gross or criminalnegligence. In many states, such actions by a passenger are prohibited; in  
other states, intentional misconduct of the driver must be shown.  
GUIDING PRINCIPLES title of a published set of rules, adhered to by member companies of major property and  
liability associations, that stipulate how losses should be adjusted when the same loss is covered by more than one  
insurance company. Particular emphasis is placed on how the cost of the losses should be apportioned among the  
companies under various situations.

HABITS behavior or character standing of an individual in a community. Some personal habits are considered in  
underwriting an insurance application.  
HAIL INSURANCE coverage against hail damage to crops. Coverage is on a proportionate basis; that is, in the event of  
loss, a farmer will recover an amount based on the ratio of the damaged part of a crop to the entire crop.  
HANGARKEEPERS LEGAL LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for the owner of an airplane in circumstances where  
use of the owner's premises as an aircraft hangar results in bodily injury or property damage to a third party. Excluded  
from coverage is property under the care, custody, and control of the insured. Another application of this policy covers  
the operator of a hangar for liability from damage to an aircraft that the owner has placed under the operator's care,  
custody, and control for storage or repair.  
HARDSHIP existence of a financial need which permits in-service withdrawals of funds from a SECTION 401 (k)  
PLAN or a SECTION 403 (b) PLAN to pay tuition for postsecondary education for a participant or his or her spouse,  
children, or other dependents.  
HAZARD circumstance that increases the likelihood or probable severity of a loss. For example, the storing of  
explosives in a home basement is a hazard that increases the probability of an explosion.  
HAZARD INCREASE RESULTING IN SUSPENSION OR EXCLUSION OF COVERAGE provision commonly  
found in fire insurance contracts. If the insured knows that a hazard is increased, most property contracts permit the  
insurance company to suspend or terminate coverage. For example, manufacture of drugs in the home would give the  
insurance company the right to invoke this clause if it could show that the manufacturing process increases the  
probability of fire. See also LOSSES PAID.

documentation is offered to confirm the illness or injury. See also DISABILITY INSURANCE; GROUP DISABILITY  
INSURANCE; GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE; HEALTH INSURANCE; HEALTH MAINTENANCE  
ORGANIZATION (HMO); SURGICAL EXPENSE INSURANCE.  
HEALTH INSURANCE FUTURES one-year futures contract (standardized agreement between two parties to buy or  
sell a commodity or financial instrument on an organized futures exchange such as the CBOT within some future time  
period at a present stipulated price), traded at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), which would allow health insurance  
companies and self-insured employers to hedge their losses. The essential design of this contract is such that when  
actual claims exceed expected claims by amount ''X," the futures contract would increase by the same amount "X." The  
financial instrument that forms the basis of this futures contract is an index that reflects the claims experience of ten  
health insurance companies. By buying futures contracts that will appreciate in the future as claims increase in the  
future, insurance companies and self-insured employers can profit from increasing futures prices through which they  
can offset their losses. Accordingly, by selling futures contracts that will decline in the future, these organizations can  
profit from decreasing futures prices  
< previous page page_218 next page >  
 
< previous page page_219 next page >  
Page 219  
that can be used to offset smaller cash flow. For example, if a health insurance company buys a futures contract for  
$40,000 and then sells it for $50,000, the company will recognize a profit of $10,000, which can be used to pay the  
higher than expected claims incurred. The cost effectiveness of hedging through the buying and selling of futures  
contracts depends on high correlations between expected claims payments and the futures contracts prices. If there is a  
low correlation between expected claims payments and the futures contracts prices, the less cost effective the hedge  
becomes. Thus, it is critical for the insurance company or the self-insured employer to establish the correlation between  
its block of business and the health insurance futures index.  
HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996 (HIPAA) legislation providing  
that, to the extent that all deductible medical care expenses exceed 7.5% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI),  
expenses not reimbursed under qualified long-term care coverages are subject to tax deductibility according to the  
medical expense deduction rule under the Internal Revenue Service Code, Section 770(b). Also regarded as deductible  
medical expenses up to a specified maximum according to the individual's age are premiums paid for qualified LONGTERM  
CARE (LTC) insurance policies. The specified maximum increases according to the age of the insured, ranging  
from $200 for insureds age 40 or younger to $2500 for those insureds older than age 70. In addition, benefits received  
from LTC policies are not included in one's taxable income subject to given restrictions. An insurer offering individual  
health insurance in an individual state cannot deny coverage to an individual leaving group coverage. Under this act  
there is guaranteed acceptance and a maternity preexisting condition prohibition. In order for the LTC contract to be  
qualified under the IRS code, the contract must be an insurance policy that restricts its coverage to only qualified longterm  
care services; the policy must be a GUARANTEED RENEWABLE CONTRACT; and the policy must not have a  
CASH VALUE.  
HEALTH INSURANCE RENEWABILITY see HEALTH INSURANCE.  
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) prepaid group health insurance plan that entitles members to  
services of participating physicians, hospitals, and clinics. Emphasis is on preventive medicine. Members of the HMO  
pay a flat periodic fee (usually deducted from each paycheck) for these medical services:  
1. HMO Managing Physiciana new member can select an HMO physician, who is then responsible for providing all of  
his or her health care needs. If necessary, the managing physician makes arrangements for the member to see a  
specialist.  
2. HMO Copaymenta member may be required to pay an amount in addition to required penodic payments, for example,  
a $5 flat fee for each visit regardless of how expensive the services may be. Or,  
< previous page page_219 next page >  
 
< previous page page_220 next page >  
Page 220  
for each prescription, to pay a flat amount of $2 regardless of the actual cost.  
3. HMO Hospital Servicesinclude, among others, room and board, operating room, laboratory tests, radiation,  
medications, and physical therapy.  
4. HMO Physicians and Surgeons Services in Hospitalinclude surgeons and related medical specialists, with no  
copayment.  
5. HMO Outpatient Hospital Caremembers receive the same services that are provided under Inpatient Hospital  
Services, as authorized by the managing physician; there is no copayment.  
6. HMO Outpatient Health Services Provided at HMO Facility include physician services, preventive health services,  
diagnosis and treatment services, skilled nursing facility services, mental health and/or alcohol and drug abuse services,  
dental care under specific circumstances, and emergency services in and out of the HMO area. A copayment may be  
required.  
HMO exclusions include custodial care, experimental procedures, conveniences not medically related such as television,  
radio, and telephones, and cosmetic care except for medically necessary reconstruction.  
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) ACT OF 1973 federal legislation requiring employers with  
traditional health plans to also provide an HMO to its employees. The act also makes it mandatory for employers to  
contribute as much to the HMO as they did to their regular plan. The requirement that employers offer an HMO  
alternative was repealed in 1993. In 1988, the act was amended so that the employer gained greater flexibility in  
determining its HMO contributions.  
HEALTH PLAN FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT (FSA) central fund into which employees contribute untaxed  
earnings to pay for the insurance premiums and uninsured medical costs. When the employee submits evidence of  
unreimbursed medical expenses, the employee is then indemnified. This indemnification fund uses untaxed dollars to  
pay for family health care costs that are not covered by the employer's health care plan. Examples would include  
elective surgery, eyeglasses, orthodontia, and the deductibles and coinsurance requirements that are part of the insured  
medical claims. The amount that the employee contributes to this account must be spent in total during that year. If this  
amount or any part thereof is not spent during that year, it is forfeited in total to the employer.  
HEDGING method of transferring RISK to permit the RISK BEARER to assume two offsetting positions at the same  
time so that, regardless of the outcome of an event, the risk bearer is left in a no win/no lose position. For example, in  
the options market, a stock owner of an underlying stock can write calls or buy puts. In the same options market, the  
short sellers of the underlying stock can buy calls or write puts.

HEDONIC DAMAGES in personal injury cases, damages awarded to the plaintiff for the loss of joy of living. For  
example, if a person's negligent act results in damage to another person's leg, the injured person claims that he/she can  
no longer walk his/her dog and thus has been deprived of one of the greatest joys in the injured person's life.  
HEINRICH, H. W. executive of Travelers Insurance Company who developed the DOMINO THEORY OF  
ACCIDENT CAUSATION by studying over 75,000 industrial accidents and concluding that most accidents would be  
preventable if only the acquired behavior of individuals could be changed. Heinrich held that extensive programs should  
be conducted by industrial companies to convince employees to act safely.  
HIGHLY PROTECTED RISK exposures where action has been taken to reduce the frequency and severity of loss, such  
as adding sprinkler systems in public buildings. These actions may result in a significant reduction in the fire insurance  
premium.  
HIGH-PRESSURE SELLING extremely aggressive behavior by an INSURANCE AGENT to convince a PROSPECT  
to purchase the insurance product without due regard for the prospect's ability to pay the PREMIUMS and/or needs for  
the product.  
HIGH RISK POOLS FOR THE MEDICALLY UNINSURABLE see STATE HIGH RISK POOLS FOR THE  
MEDICALLY UNINSURABLE.  
HOBBIES OR AVOCATIONS activities of interest in underwriting an application for life insurance to determine the  
rate classification (premium) for the applicant. For example, a sky diver is at greater personal risk than average, and  
accordingly is charged a much higher premium for life insurance.  
HOLD-HARMLESS AGREEMENT assumption of liability through contractual agreement by one party, thereby  
eliminating liability on the part of another party. An example is a railroad sidetrack agreement with a manufacturing  
company under which the manufacturer is held harmless for damage to railroad equipment and tracks.

HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY package policy that combines (1) coverage against the insured's property  
being destroyed or damaged by various perils, and (2) coverage for liability exposure of the insured.  
Homeowners policies cover both individuals as well as property. In addition to the insured, those covered include his or  
her spouse, their relatives, and any others under 21 who are residents of the insured's household.  
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICYSECTION I (PROPERTY COVERAGE) section providing protection in four  
areas:  
1. Coverage A (Home)the structure of the home (basic contract amount). Other property coverages in Section I are  
expressed as a percentage of Coverage A.  
2. Coverage B (Garage or Appurtenant Private Structures)structures not attached to or part of the home, covered up to  
10% of the basic home structure.  
3. Coverage C (Contents or Personal Property)coverage of 40 to 50% (depending on the form selected) of the structural  
coverage of the home for the contents or personal property in the home; coverage of up to 10% applies to contents away  
from the home. For example, a home whose value is $100,000 would have coverage on the contents of $50,000  
(assuming 50% contents coverage); away from home, contents coverage would be up to $5000.  
4. Coverage D (Additional Living Expenses)coverage if the home is damaged or destroyed and the insured must seek  
temporary lodging. Reimbursement is 10 to 20% of the structural coverage of the home, depending on the form selected,  
All four property coverages A, B, C, and D are offered through one of the following forms:  
1. Form No. 1 (Basic or Standard)coverage for fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, smoke, theft, vandalism,  
malicious mischief, riot, civil commotion, glass breakage, vehicles, and aircraft.  
2. Form No. 2 (Broad)coverage for a broader spectrum of perils than under Form No. 1.  
3. Form No. 3 (Special)provides that Coverage A (Home), Coverage B (Garage or Appurtenant Private Structures), and  
Coverage C (Contents or Personal Property) are insured on an ALL RISKS basis. This form is sometimes called  
"landlords and tenants insurance" since the building and garage or appurtenant private structure and contents are  
covered on an all risks basis. There are a number of exclusions under Form No. 3.  
4. Form No. 4 (Contents Broad Form)coverage only for the contents of a dwelling (Coverage C) and additional living  
expense (Coverage D) as the result of the perils listed in Form No. 2. This  
< previous page page_222 next page >  
 
< previous page page_223 next page >  
Page 223  
form is called the "renters form" since it does not cover damage to the structure of an apartment building, its garages or  
appurtenants.  
5. Form No. 6 (Condominium Unit Owners Form)provides the same coverage as Form No. 4 but extends coverage for  
damage to additions and/or alterations that the unit owner may have made inside the unit. Coverage goes into effect as  
an excess amount above that insurance (if any) that the condominium association may have. Numerous endorsements  
can be added to each one of the above forms to increase the limits of coverage and the properties insured. For example,  
specified property such as jewelry, furs, silverware, and guns can be added through a valuable personal articles  
endorsement. Also, an inflation guard endorsement (reflecting increases in the cost of construction) can be added to  
Coverage A, which automatically increases Coverages B, C, and D, since they are expressed as a percentage of  
Coverage A.  
The insured is obligated to take certain actions following a loss, including: notifying the company or agent immediately;  
if the loss is due to theft, notifying the police immediately; if credit cards are stolen, notifying the credit card company  
immediately; and protecting the property from further damage.  
There is usually an 80% coinsurance requirement which means that the insured must carry insurance on a replacement  
cost basis of at least 80%. For example, a home is worth $200,000, and a fire does $50,000 damage. If the insured  
carries $150,000 of insurance, only $46,875 would be covered according to the following formula:  
Replacement Cost Basis  
If, however, the insured had carried an 80% insurance to a value of $160,000, then the total loss of $50,000 would have  
been to the following formula:  
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICYSECTION II (LIABILITY COVERAGE) section providing protection under  
three coverages:  
1. Coverage E (Personal Liability)coverage in the event a suit is brought against the insured because of bodily injury  
and/or property damage resulting from the acts or non-acts of the insured. Also covers the insured's spouse, relatives of  
either, and others under age 21 under the insured's care. Just about any personal act is insured. For example, if the  
insured lives in Shreveport, Louisiana,  
< previous page page_223 next page >  
 
< previous page page_224 next page >  
Page 224  
and hits someone with a tennis ball in a game in Hong Kong, the insured is covered against a possible lawsuit. The  
insurance company must also pay for the costs of defending the insured, even if a suit has no reasonable basis. Defense  
costs are separate and in addition to the limits of liability in the policy. For example, if the limits of the policy are  
$100,000 and the defense costs are $200,000, the insurance company could have to pay a total of $300,000 on behalf of  
the insured. Once the insurance company pays the $100,000 limit in the policy, the insurance company's obligation to  
defend the insured any further ends. The basic liability limits are $100,000the minimum amount stipulated in the policy.  
(For a relatively few dollars these limits can be increased substantially.)  
2. Coverage F (Medical Payments to Others)coverage for reimbursement of reasonable medical expenses incurred (a)  
by the insured (and individuals as defined in Coverage E, above); and (b) for injuries sustained by a third party either on  
or off of the insured's premises as a result of the activities of the insured and others covered. This is called "Good  
Samaritan Coverage" because by providing emergency medical expenses of an injured third party, the insured does not  
admit liability, nor does the injured third party relinquish his or her right to bring suit against the insured by accepting  
the medical aid.  
3. Coverage G (Damage to Property of Others)as with Coverage F, the insured is reimbursed for expenses incurred up  
to $250 regardless of legal liability for damage to the property of a third party. The insured and covered residents of the  
household make payment out of a feeling of moral responsibility for the damage to the property, which may have the  
result of a liability suit not being brought.

HOMOGENEOUS EXPOSURES elements within a group under study that have the same characteristic(s), have the  
same EXPECTATION OF LOSS, are very much alike with respect to the variable under consideration,  
< previous page page_224 next page >  
 
< previous page page_225 next page >  
Page 225  
and do not show significant differences through any given time periods. Homogeneity of exposure units is extremely  
important to the accuracy of the prediction of future losses based on historical loss experience. For example, if an  
ACTUARY is going to predict the number of wood-frame houses likely to suffer a fire loss, the sample upon which the  
prediction is based should consist of wood-frame houses, not brick-frame houses.  
HOSPICE facility that provides short periods of stay for a terminally ill person in a homelike setting for either direct  
care or respite. A "terminally ill" person has a life expectancy of six months or less. A hospice provides continuous care.  
Some health insurance plans pay benefits in full up to a maximum without a deductible for charges incurred for a  
terminally ill person while in a hospice care program. Also provided are bereavement benefits up to a maximum  
(usually $200) per family unit.  
HOSPITAL CONFINEMENT INDEMNITY INSURANCE policy that pays a fixed dollar amount for each day the  
insured is confined to the hospital. This method of payment is in contrast with most other MEDICAL EXPENSE  
INSURANCE that reimburses the insured on the costs incurred.

HOSTILE FIRE unfriendly fire not confined to its normal habitat. For example, fire in the fireplace leaps onto the sofa.  
Property contracts protect against damage from a hostile fire, not from damage from fire in the fireplace, its normal  
habitat. The insurance is designed to cover FORTUITOUS LOSS, which the hostile fire is. See also FRIENDLY FIRE.

persons already intoxicated, resulting in these intoxicated individuals causing property damage and/or bodily injury to  
third parties. See also DRAM SHOP LAW.  
HOST LIQUOR LIABILITY see HOST LIABILITY.  
HOUSEHOLD INVENTORY list and description of valuables, to be utilized in the event an insurance claim must be  
filed. Included should be: (1) a detailed explanation of possessions that are of special value, such as a piano or violin;  
(2) appraisals on expensive items such as jewelry, art, furs, and antiques; (3) make and model numbers of electronic  
equipment and appliances. A photograph and/or videotape should be taken of the important items in the home showing  
their condition and quality.  
HOUSING STARTS INDICATOR index that traces the construction of new single-family homes, townhouses, and  
multifamily apartment buildings. These statistics are published monthly by the United States Department of Commerce.  
Rising housing starts is one sign of a healthy economy.  
HOW LONG A POLICY WILL BE IN FORCE duration of a policy. Property and casualty coverages are usually  
written for one year, although a personal automobile policy can be for six months. Life insurance can be written on (1) a  
term basis (1 year, 5 years, 20 years, to age 65), (2) whole or life basis, or (3) any combination of the two. Health  
insurance can be written on a multiple time period basis.  
HR-10 PLAN see KEOGH PLAN (HR-10).  
HULL MARINE INSURANCE coverage of the hull of a ship and its tackle, passenger fittings, equipment, stores, boats,  
and ordnance. Coverage is provided under the following types of policies: BUILDERS RISK HULL INSURANCE;  
NAVIGATION RISK INSURANCE, and PORT RISK INSURANCE.  
HUMAN APPROACH technique of loss control and reduction of losses in insurance. Supporters of this method believe  
that the safety attitudes of individuals determine the safety precautions they take. The human approach seeks to  
convince people to want to be safe in order to reduce loss frequency and severity. For example, campaigns encouraging  
the use of seat belts help promote a safety-conscious society.  
HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING see HUMAN APPROACH.  
HUMAN LIFE VALUE APPROACH (ECONOMIC VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIFE) (EVOIL) quantitative  
measure to determine the amount of life insurance required to replace lost future earnings of a wage earner. Three steps  
are used in arriving at the needed sum:  
1. Determine average yearly earned income devoted to a family in the future by the wage earner (AEIDF).  
< previous page page_226 next page >  
 
< previous page page_227 next page >  
Page 227  
2. Determine future number of years wage earner is planning to work (n).  
3. Determine the interest rate (i) (discount factor) to be used in calculating the present value of the average yearly  
earned income devoted to family.  
The calculation uses this equation:  
HURRICANE INSURANCE part of windstorm coverage, usually one of a group of property coverages that covers all  
kinds of winds such as storms and tornadoes. See also STORM INSURANCE (WINDSTORM INSURANCE).

I 
IBNR see INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED LOSSES (IBNR).  
I-BONDS bonds issued by the United States Treasury that earn a fixed interest rate plus the rate of inflation. These  
bonds are sold at face value in denominations of $50 up to $5000 and may earn interest for up to 30 years. These bonds  
may be liquidated at any time after they have been in force for at least six months, but if liquidation occurs during the  
first five years, three months of interest must be forfeited. The interest earned is compounded twice a year and paid  
when the bond is redeemed. Protection against loss of principal and purchasing power while accumulating tax-deferred  
interest are some of the advantages of this Treasury-backed issue.  
IDENTIFICATION first step in the risk management process. The objective is to determine the sources of losses. For  
example, the profit and loss statement of a business firm not only shows the sources of its earnings but identifies  
exposures that these sources face from various perils, such as worker injuries, ill-designed products, and hazardous  
manufacturing conditions.  
IMMEDIATE ANNUITY ANNUITY that begins payments after a single premium is paid. For example, the annuitant  
pays a single premium of $100,000 on June 1 of the current year and begins receiving a monthly income of $1200 for  
life starting July 1.  
IMMEDIATE NOTICE provision found in PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE policies that mandates that  
the insured notify the insurance company as soon as possible following the occurrence of a covered loss under the  
policy.  
IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION GUARANTEE PLAN (IPG) see PENSION PLAN FUNDING: GROUP  
IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION GUARANTEED (IPA) CONTRACT ANNUITY.  
IMMEDIATE VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT a contract sold by insurance companies that is bought by means of  
a single lump sum payment usually providing a monthly income payment for the ANNUITANT's life. The amount of  
the monthly income payment varies according to the performance of the underlying portfolio of investments. A  
stipulated rate of return (ASSUMED INTEREST RATE/ASSUMED INVESTMENT RETURN) is assumed when the  
insurer calculates the initial income payment to the annuitant. If the underlying portfolio produces a net return greater  
than or less than the stipulated rate of return, the income payments will rise or decline accordingly. See also ANNUITY;  
VARIABLE ANNUITY.  
IMMEDIATE VESTING entitlement of an employee to benefits immediately upon entering a retirement plan. As  
benefits are earned, they  
< previous page page_228 next page >  
 
< previous page page_229 next page >  
Page 229  
are credited to the employee's account. These ''portable" future benefits can be withdrawn by individuals leaving the  
service of the employer.  
IMPAIRED RISK IMMEDIATE ANNUITIES income payments that are calculated based on the ANNUITANT'S LIFE  
EXPECTANCY and adjusted to reflect the annuitant's medical circumstance. For example, a person age 63 may have a  
medical impairment that gives him or her the same life expectancy as that of a person age 73. The income payment can  
be increased accordingly to reflect the shorter life expectancy.  
IMPAIRED RISK (SUBSTANDARD RISK) in life and health insurance, person whose physical condition is less than  
standard or who has a hazardous occupation or hobby. For example, an applicant with a history of strokes is regarded as  
an impaired risk. Some substandard insurance companies specialize in insuring substandard risks, applying an  
additional premium (surcharge) to reflect the higher probability of loss from a particular impairment.  
IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL situation where a stock insurer must invade its capital account in order to meet its  
obligations. Most states do not allow insurers to do this and quickly rescind their right to do business.  
IMPLIED AUTHORITY see APPARENT AGENCY (AUTHORITY).  
IMPREST ACCOUNT fund established to pay specified losses, usually the low severity property losses. This type of  
account is an excellent device in conjunction with a SELF-INSURANCE plan, in which the fund is infused with new  
money as it goes to zero after paying property losses.  
IMPROVEMENTS AND BETTERMENTS INSURANCE tenant's modifications of leased space to fit his particular  
needs. Up to 10% of contents coverage inside the structure may be applied to insure against damage or destruction of  
improvements or betterments made by a tenant who does not carry coverage on the structure itself. For example, under  
the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, if the contents of an apartment are insured for $25,000, then $2500  
would apply to cabinets that the tenant built into the kitchen.  
INADMITTED ASSET ASSET excluded from the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS submitted to the state INSURANCE  
EXAMINER because the asset has virtually no value in meeting claims in the event the INSURANCE COMPANY  
must be liquidated. Also called NONADMITTED ASSET.  
IN-AREA EMERGENCY SERVICES provision of HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) coverage.  
A member who is critically injured within the geographical service area of the HMO can use the nearest hospital for  
emergency care, rather than a more distant HMO-authorized hospital.

provided that the owner of the property is not responsible for the arson.  
INCEPTION DATE see EFFECTIVE DATE.  
INCHMAREE CLAUSE provision of MARINE INSURANCE. It protects property damaged or destroyed as the result  
of the negligent acts of the crew. The name is derived from a steamer in which a pump was damaged by its crew's  
negligence.  
INCIDENCE RATE see FREQUENCY AND DISTRIBUTION OF LOSSES.  
INCIDENTAL CONTRACT secondary (not primary) reason for forming a contract. In group insurance, the group must  
be formed and maintained for reasons other than obtaining insurance. If the group were formed primarily to obtain  
insurance, ADVERSE SELECTION would take place.  
INCIDENTAL MALPRACTICE medical malpractice that is the legal responsibility of a person or organization not in  
the medical profession or business. It is usually covered under a PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE policy.  
INCIDENTS OF OWNERSHIP policyowner rights under a life insurance policy, including the right to name a new  
beneficiary at any time and to surrender the policy for its cash value.  
INCOME all sources of cash flow, usually stated on an annual basis.  
INCOME AND PRINCIPAL POLICY policy that provides an income for life to the primary BENEFICIARY upon the  
death of the INSURED. The FACE AMOUNT of the policy becomes payable to the secondary beneficiary upon the  
death of the primary beneficiary. Should the primary beneficiary die before the insured, the face amount of the policy is  
paid to the secondary beneficiary upon the death of the insured.  
INCOME AVERAGING income averaged over a specified period of years. For example, to calculate benefits in a  
pension plan, it is common to average the highest three years or five years of earnings.  
INCOME BENEFICIARY individual(s) entitled to receive the income generated by the TRUST.  
INCOME CONTINUATION INSURANCE see PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE.  
INCOME IN RESPECT OF A DECEDENT (IRD) classification at death of all PENSION PLANS, PROFITSHARING  
PLANS, INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (IRAs), ANNUITIES, and installment payments to  
the extent to which the deceased was entitled to receive income and that income was not included in the deceased's  
taxable income in the year of the death. This income is ruled to be subject to income tax to the BENEFICIARY as well  
as ESTATE TAX to the heirs.

INCOME REPLACEMENT RATIO percentage of income required by a retiree to maintain a desired standard of living  
during the retirement years.  
INCOME-SHIFTING STRATEGIES ownership of tax-free or tax-deferred investments by a child or for a child, given  
that these investments will not reach maturity before the child attains at least age 14. The objective is to shift investment  
producing current income from high-tax-bracket adults to low-tax-bracket children. Possible means of achieving this  
objective would be the utilization of the following investment instruments:  
1. Municipal bondsinterest earned is not subject to federal or state taxes.  
2. Savings bonds U.S. EE savings bonds that have a maturity date after the child attains age 14these bonds guarantee  
payment of 85% of the average interest rate of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds subject to a minimum guarantee rate of  
6%. These bonds must be held for at least five years for the full interest rate to apply.  
3. PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCEearnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis with the possibility of avoiding taxes  
on the accrued earnings if the policy remains in force until the insured's death.  
4. DEFERRED ANNUITYthis instrument offers the same tax-deferred treatment as life insurance.  
5. Growth equitiestaxes need not be paid on "paper gains;" taxes on gains are paid only after stock is sold.  
6. Custodial accountparent retains control of the asset owned by the child until the child reaches the age of majority.  
The first $1000 of income in the account is taxed at the child's rate (if child is less than age 14), and any additional  
income is taxed at the parent's rate. When the child reaches age 14, all income in the account becomes taxable at the  
child's rate.  
INCONTESTABLE CLAUSE section in a life insurance policy stating that after the policy is in force two years, the  
company cannot void it because of misrepresentation or concealment by the insured in obtaining

Page 232  
the policy. For example, when asked on the application if there is a history of diabetes in the family, the applicant writes  
no, knowing that his or her father and mother both have diabetes. This does not void the policy after two years.  
However, if the age of the applicant had been understatedsay, to obtain a lower premiumthe company will recalculate  
the benefit according to the correct age.  
INCORPORATION INTO FUNDING AGREEMENT factors taken into account concerning the instrument used in  
funding a pension plan. For example, an allocated funding instrument guarantees that benefits will be paid for all  
premium payments received. This should eliminate concerns of employees about the availability of funds to pay their  
benefits at retirement.  
INCORPOREAL INTERESTS right to insurable interest in property such as the right of a secured creditor in the  
property pledged as security.  
INCREASED COST ENDORSEMENT coverage for extra expenses associated with the reconstruction of a damaged or  
destroyed building where zoning requirements mandate more costly construction material. This endorsement is attached  
to property policies.  
INCREASED COST OF CONSTRUCTION CLAUSE coverage if state or municipal law requires that a damaged or  
destroyed building must be rebuilt at an increased cost to comply with building code provisions that were not in effect  
when the building was originally constructed.  
INCREASED HAZARD state that increases the probability of a loss. For example, storage of flammable material next  
to a furnace in one's home increases the hazard with the knowledge of an insured, and is grounds for suspension of a  
policy by an insurance company.  
INCREASING LIFE INSURANCE term or whole life policy with a face value that increases over time.  
INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED LOSSES (IBNR) insured losses that have occurred but have not been reported to  
a PRIMARY INSURANCE company. These types of claims have a tremendous effect on a REINSURANCE treaty,  
which may be showing a healthy profit when in reality it is losing money. Hence, under this false security, the reinsurer  
will continue operating under a rating plan that is totally inadequate for the losses. This explains why a provision for  
incurred but not reported losses should be made in a rating plan. Also, the reinsurer must establish an adequate reserve  
for IBNR claims to make a correct analysis of its business. If such a reserve is not established, overly optimistic  
evaluation of the real loss may not be revealed for several years. A method of deriving the reserve for IBNR claims is to  
calculate a percentage of the Claims Paid and Outstanding.  
INCURRED EXPENSES expenses that have or may not yet have been paid by an insurance company.

INCURRED LOSSES losses that have occurred within a stipulated time period whether paid or not.  
INCURRED LOSS RATIO proportion of losses incurred to premiums earned. This ratio indicates the amount of a  
premium dollar that is being consumed by losses.  
INDEMNIFY see INDEMNITY.  
INDEMNITEE recipient of an indemnity.  
INDEMNITOR provider of an indemnity payment.  
INDEMNITY compensation for loss. In a property and casualty contract, the objective is to restore an insured to the  
same financial position after the loss that he or she was in prior to the loss. But the insured should not be able to profit  
by damage or destruction of property, nor should the insured be in a worse financial position after a loss.  
In life insurance the situation is totally different. By the payment of a single premium, the beneficiary of an insured can  
be placed in a much better financial position at the death of an insured than he or she was in prior to the death.  
However, the payment of a predetermined amount upon the insured's death does not make a life insurance policy a  
contract of indemnity.  
In hospital indemnity and other health insurance plans, COORDINATION OF BENEFITS is designed so that the  
insured cannot profit from an illness. See also COORDINATION OF BENEFITS.  
INDEMNITY AGREEMENT policy provision designed to restore an insured to his or her original financial position  
after a loss. The insured should neither profit nor be put at a monetary disadvantage by incurring the loss. See also  
INSURANCE CONTRACT, GENERAL; INSURANCE CONTRACT, LIFE; INSURANCE CONTRACT,  
PROPERTY AND CASUALTY.  
INDEMNITY BOND coverage for loss of an obligee in the event that the principal fails to perform according to  
standards agreed upon between the obligee and the principal.  
INDEMNITY COMPANY INSURANCE COMPANY that specializes in UNDERWRITING CASUALTY  
INSURANCE.  
INDEMNITY DISABILITY INCOME POLICY policy used to provide the funds necessary for BUY-AND-SELL  
AGREEMENTS whereby an income payment or a series of income payments are paid to the buyer of the disabled  
partner's interest contained in a PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN or disabled stockholder's  
interest contained in a CLOSE CORPORATION PLAN to reimburse that buyer for the sum paid. If this sum to be paid  
the buyer by the insurance company exceeds the actual market value of the business at the time of the sale, that sum  
must still be paid.  
INDEMNITY OR FEE-FOR-SERVICE INSURANCE coverage for the percentage of the health care costs paid by the  
health insurance

company, which is usually 80% above the insured's deductible up to a dollar amount of approximately $5000. The  
company then pays 100% of the costs up to the policy limits. The insured may select a physician of his or her choice.  
INDEPENDENT ADJUSTER independent contractor who adjusts claims for different insurance companies. Such  
services are used by insurance companies whose financial resources or volume of claims do not warrant employing their  
own in-house adjusters.  
INDEPENDENT AGENCY SYSTEM means of selling and servicing property and casualty insurance through agents  
who represent different companies. The agents own the records of the policies they sell. See also INDEPENDENT  
AGENT.  
INDEPENDENT AGENT contractor who represents different insurance companies and who searches the market for the  
best place for a client's business. The independent agent, who owns the records of policies sold, is not controlled by any  
one company, pays agency's expenses out of the commissions earned, and is responsible for maintaining employee  
benefits.  
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INSURANCE see OWNERS AND CONTRACTORS PROTECTIVE LIABILITY  
INSURANCE.  
INDEPENDENT EVENTS events that do not have any influence on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of another event;  
for example, a plane crashing in Shreveport should have no influence on a plane crashing in Dallas.  
INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS OF AMERICA (IIAA) association of independent agents whose objective is  
to further the interests of these agents through education, lobbying, and professional ethics.  
INDEPENDENT INSURER insurance company that is not a member of a rating bureau or is not under common  
ownership or management with other companies. The insurance company is said to stand alone. See also  
INDEPENDENT AGENCY SYSTEM; INDEPENDENT AGENT.  
INDEPENDENT PRACTICE ASSOCIATION (IPA) type of HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO)  
that issues contracts to independent physicians. These physicians are paid a per visit fee for seeing an HMO member or  
are paid an annual fixed sum. The HMO members are covered only when they use an HMO hospital or physician.  
INDETERMINATE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE nonparticipating life insurance under which the first few annual  
premiums are smaller than would be the case under a traditional nonparticipating policy. While the maximum amount of  
these initial premiums is guaranteed, future premiums can be increased, but not beyond a guaranteed maximum.  
Adjustments to premiums reflect the insurance

company's anticipated mortality experience, investment return, and expenses. If these three elements are more profitable  
than had been loaded for in the initial premiums, future premiums will be reduced; if less profitable, they will be  
increased, but not greater than the guaranteed maximum. See also ADJUSTABLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
INDEX ANNUITY see EQUITY INDEXED ANNUITY.  
INDEXED LIFE INSURANCE policy with a face value that varies according to a prescribed index of prices; otherwise  
benefits provided are similar to ordinary whole life. The death benefit is based on the particular index used, such as the  
Consumer Price Index (CPI). The policyowner has the choice of having the index applied either automatically or on an  
elective basis. With an automatic index increase, the premium remains level since it has already been loaded to reflect  
the automatic increase. If the policy allows for an optional index increase, an extra premium is charged when this option  
is exercised by the policyowner. Regardless of which index is selectedautomatic or optionalthe increased death benefit  
does not require another physical examination or other evidence of insurability.  
INDEXED GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACT (GIC) type of GUARANTEED INVESTMENT  
CONTRACT in which the interest rate credited is tied to an external index such as the United States Treasury Bond  
Index.  
INDEXED LIFE POLICIES see INDEXED LIFE INSURANCE.  
INDEXED SECURITIES (STRUCTURED NOTES) bond DERIVATIVES of short-term duration whose principal or  
coupon value is determined by a market index. Market indexes that can be utilized include securities, commodity prices,  
and short-term bond rates.  
INDIRECT LOSS loss that is not a direct result of a peril. For example, damage to property of a business firm would be  
a direct loss, but the loss of business earnings because of a fire on its premises would be an indirect loss.  
INDIRECT PROPERTY EXPOSURES loss of income resulting from the damage or destruction of a person's property  
or a business's property. For example, if a store is damaged by fire and is unable to sell its inventory to customers, a loss  
of income results.  
INDIVIDUAL ANNUITY TABLE, 1971 historical MORTALITY TABLE that replaced the ANNUITY TABLE, 1949,  
used for the calculation of annuity rates with more-current mortality experience at that time. This table was  
subsequently replaced by the 1983 Table-a (mortality table used for the calculation of annuity rates for males).

INDIVIDUAL FIDELITY BOND bond that reimburses a business for loss caused by the dishonest act of an employee.  
Since crime insurance policies exclude coverage of dishonest acts of employees, it is necessary to have a fidelity bond  
for this protection. Fidelity bonds cover mercantile business and financial institutions. See also FIDELITY BOND.

INDIVIDUAL LEVEL COST METHOD means, in pension plans, by which a projection is made of benefits credited to  
each employee's account at retirement age. Costs are then allocated on a level basis over a specified future period of  
time. This cost method can be classified according to whether there is or is not a supplemental liability. See also  
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL COST METHOD SUPPLEMENTAL WITHOUT LIABILITY; INDIVIDUAL LEVEL COST  
METHOD WITH SUPPLEMENTAL LIABILITY.  
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL COST METHOD WITHOUT SUPPLE-MENTAL LIABILITY means of projecting the costs of  
pension plans on a level basis over a specified future period of time. The actuarial value of each employee's future  
benefits to be paid at retirement is determined (including past service benefits to be credited, if any), and their costs are  
spread equally over the remaining work experience of the employee. The equation states that the present value of future  
benefits equals the present value of future costs.  
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL COST METHOD WITH SUPPLEMENTAL LIABILITY means of projecting the costs of  
pension plans on a level basis over a specified future period of time. The actuarial value of each employee's future  
benefits to be paid at retirement is determined (beginning with the first day an employee could have joined the pension  
plan, had it been in effect at that timethereby creating a supplemental liability), and their costs are spread equally over  
the remaining work experience of the employee.

INDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE coverage of a single life, in contrast to group life insurance, which covers many lives. See  
also ENDOWMENT INSURANCE; LIFE INSURANCE; ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE; TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
INDIVIDUAL POLICY PENSION TRUST type of PENSION PLAN in which the employer (if NONCONTRIBUTORY plan)  
or the employer and employee (if CONTRIBUTORY plan) make level annual premium payments to fund the future retirement  
benefits, through an individual DEFERRED ANNUITY, of the employee. Also funded in this manner is a separate life  
insurance policy on each employee. (This policy is usually held in the trust.) See also PENSION PLAN FUNDING,  
INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT PENSION PLAN.  
INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE ASSOCIATION HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) HEALTH  
MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION that provides medical services to the HMO members through an exclusive contract with  
specific physicians and hospitals. These selected physicians and hospitals provide medical services to both HMO members and  
non-HMO members. Generally, HMO members may select the primary care physician of their choice from the list of specific  
physicians. After rendering services to the HMO member, the physician is paid a predetermined fee by the HMO.  
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) traditional fund under the TAX REFORMACT OF 1986 into which any  
individual employee can contribute up to $2000. Unemployed spouses may contribute up to $2000 even if the working spouse  
does not make a contribution. However, income level and eligibility for an employee pension plan determine whether or not the  
employee's contribution or a percentage is tax deductible. The following are the circumstances of contribution to an IRA and the  
tax consequences under the current law:

employee to have benefits vested.) IRA earnings remain tax deferred. Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a  
10% penalty except for disability, death, to pay qualified higher education expenses, the purchase of a first home (there  
is a $10,000 lifetime limit on withdrawals for first-time home buyers), or to pay qualified medical expenses. Under the  
new law, each phase-out range has increased from $50,000 to $60,000 in 1998 to $80,000 to $100,000 in 2007 for  
married taxpayers filing jointly; and from $30,000 to $40,000 in 1998 to $50,000 to $60,000 in 2005 for single  
taxpayers.  
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT FUNDING INSTRUMENTS under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT  
INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA), the INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (BANK TRUST  
CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT, MUTUAL FUND CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT, SELF-DIRECTED CUSTODIAL  
ACCOUNT), or the INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY may be utilized.  
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT PLUS (IRA PLUS) proposal, endorsed by then-President Bush and  
Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady, which expands in a significant manner the number of individuals who could  
take advantage of the effect of tax-deferred compounding of savings for retirement. The plan would be available to  
everyone since there are no income caps, to include employees who are covered under an employer's qualified pension  
plan. A spouse without an earned income could also establish such an account. Contributions to this account would be  
made with after-tax dollars. All principal would compound on a tax-free basis, so that no taxes would be due upon  
distribution. As the plan is currently designed, a participant could withdraw without penalty up to 25% of his or her  
account to purchase a first home, to meet catastrophic medical bills, or to pay for college expenses. Contrast with  
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA).  
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY type of INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) allowed by the  
EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) whereby contributions in the form of  
premium payments are made on a FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY or VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY or both.  
INDIVIDUAL RISK PREMIUM MODIFICATION PLAN in group insurance, adjustment of premiums, because of  
reduced expenses due to economy of scale. Group life premiums are subject to negotiation and modification because of  
administrative savings in dealing with large numbers of people. In contrast, a single person cannot negotiate his or her  
premium rate because each policy is handled individually.  
INDIVIDUAL STOCK PURCHASE PLAN see CLOSE CORPORATION PLAN.  
INDIVISIBLE CONTRACT inability to divide a CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE policy into a savings element and  
a protection element because, in theory, if the POLICYOWNER withdraws a portion or all of the cash value, there is a  
reduction in the DEATH BENEFIT.

INDUCEMENT TO ESTABLISHMENT OF PENSION PLANS circumstances that encourage the organization of  
pension plans by employers. For example, employer contributions are tax deductible as business expenses and not  
currently taxable income to employees. Pensions also help attract employees, maintain employee loyalty, and help  
improve the image of a business firm in its community.  
INDUCTIVE REASONING type of logic that makes the assumption that what has happened in the past will happen in  
the future, given the same conditions surrounding the two occurrences. In other words, ''History repeats itself." In  
insurance, an example would involve the assumption of future wooden frame houses burning if the same conditions  
exist now that existed in the past when wooden frame houses burned.  
INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE see INDUSTRIAL LIFE INSURANCE.  
INDUSTRIAL INSURED one who purchases insurance, usually property and liability and not life or annuities, by  
utilizing his or her own employee purchaser or licensed broker/agent at a minimum annual premium of not less than six

INFLATION ENDORSEMENT attachment to a property insurance policy that automatically adjusts its coverage  
according to the construction cost index in a community. This endorsement is necessary in a property contract to  
maintain adequate coverage. Otherwise, it is advisable for a policyowner, at time of renewal, to adjust the limits of  
coverage to reflect the increased cost of construction and the market value of the property.

IN-FORCE BUSINESS aggregate amount of insurance policies that are paid-up (or are being paid) that a life or health  
insurance company has on its books. The size of a life or health insurance company is often measured by its in-force  
business. In a life insurance company, the measure is expressed as a face amount of the insurer's portfolio. In a health  
insurance company, the measure is expressed as premium volume.  
IN-FORCE REQUIREMENT need for an insurance policy to be paid up or to be paid for a minimum number of years  
before the insured is eligible to receive any benefits. This requirement is typically found in LONG-TERM CARE (LTC)  
insurance policies.  
INHERENT EXPLOSION CLAUSE provision of a property insurance policy which covers conditions usually present  
in a particular location. For example, there is an inherent risk of explosion in a flour mill.

For example, the roofing material used may not be able to withstand a wind force of more than 15 miles per hour.  
INHERITANCE TAX tax on the right to acquire ASSETS that are transferred to a BENEFICIARY at the death of the  
owner of those assets.  
INITIAL PREMIUM premium paid at the time a policy goes into effect. With some policies, such as group health  
insurance, premiums are subject to adjustment at the end of the policy period to reflect loss experience. If the loss  
experience is good (that is, if the losses are smaller than anticipated in the premium loading), a significant premium  
reduction can be made at the end of the policy period, with a refund going to the policyowner. See also PREMIUM.  
INITIAL RESERVE reserve at the beginning of the POLICY YEAR that is equal to the TERMINAL RESERVE for the  
preceding year plus the NET LEVEL PREMIUM for the current year.  
INJUNCTION BOND type of judicial bond under which a plaintiff is held liable for damages in the event of a false  
injunction. The objective of this bond is to protect the party who has been wrongly accused by a plaintiff and suffers  
financial loss.

business.  
INSOLVENCY FUND see GUARANTY FUND (INSOLVENCY FUND).  
INSPECTION in property or liability insurance, right retained by the company to inspect the insured premises as well  
as its operations in order to detect inherent structural defects and other hidden hazards. Inspections also help reduce loss  
frequency and severity through recommended safety engineering loss prevention and reduction procedures. In  
WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE, the insurance company must inspect the business's payroll record since  
premiums are based on the business's gross payroll. In LIFE INSURANCE, the company may obtain verification of  
statements by an applicant and other information.  
INSPECTION RECEIPT form provided for an INSPECTION REPORT.  
INSPECTION REPORT statement prepared by an inspection bureau for a life or health insurance company that  
summarizes information about an applicant for a policy, including financial standing, morals, physical condition, habits,  
and other information. This report is used by a company underwriter in evaluating an application for insurance; that is,  
whether the company should classify an individual as a standard risk at standard insurance rates, as a substandard risk  
(charged an extra rate), or as uninsurable.  
INSPECTION SLIP see INSPECTION RECEIPT.  
INSPECTOR person who has the responsibility for examining the RISK to determine whether or not to insure it.  
INSTALLATION INSURANCE property coverage on a dealer's interest in equipment while it is being installed. Labor  
and material are protected against such perils as fire, lightning, and windstorm. For example, if an elevator was installed  
and it was damaged or destroyed before the buyer could take possession, the contractor would lose the cost of labor and  
materials if there was no installation insurance.  
INSTALLMENT REFUND see INSTALLMENT REFUND ANNUITY.  
INSTALLMENT REFUND ANNUITY ANNUITY contract. If the annuitant dies before receiving income at least equal  
to the premiums paid, a beneficiary receives the difference in installments. If the annuitant lives after the income paid  
equals the premiums paid, the insurance company continues to make income payments to the annuitant for life.

INSTRUMENTALITIES OF TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE coverage for entities (other than motorized vehicles)  
used in the transportation of property, including BRIDGE INSURANCE; BRIDGE INSURANCE FOR BRIDGES  
UNDER CONSTRUCTION; PIERS, WHARVES, DOCKS AND SLIPS INSURANCE; RADIO AND TELEVISION  
TRANSMITTING EQUIPMENT; TRANSMISSION LINES, PIPE LINES; TRAFFIC LIGHTS INSURANCE;  
TUNNEL INSURANCE.  
INSURABILITY circumstance in which an insurance company can issue life or health insurance to an applicant based  
on standards set by the company.  
INSURABILITY CONDITIONAL PREMIUM RECEIPT offer made by the insurance company to insure an applicant,  
provided the applicant is insurable according to the UNDERWRITING standards of the company, and the applicant  
accepts the offer by making the PREMIUM payment. If the applicant should die prior to the APPLICATION and  
premium reaching the HOME OFFICE, and the applicant would have qualified for INSURED status according to the  
underwriting standards of the company, the DEATH BENEFIT would be paid to the applicant's BENEFICIARY. Thus,  
the insurance policy applied for goes into effect upon the date of the CONDITIONAL RECEIPT if the applicant is later  
found to be insurable according to the underwriting standards of the company.  
INSURABLE INTEREST expectation of a monetary loss that can be covered by insurance. Insurable interest varies  
according to the type of policy. These relationships give rise to insurable interest: (1) owner of the property; (2) vendor  
(to the extent of the unpaid balance due on the property sold to the vendee); (3) vendee; (4) bailee (to the extent of the  
value of the property under his or her temporary care, custody, and control); (5) bailor; (6) life estates; (7) fee simple  
estates; (8) mortgagee (to the extent of the unpaid balance due on the loan to which the property is pledged as security);  
and (9) mortgagor. See also INSURABLE INTEREST: LIFE INSURANCE; INSURABLE INTEREST: PROPERTY  
AND CASUALTY INSURANCE.  
INSURABLE INTEREST: LIFE INSURANCE  
1. each individual has an unlimited insurable interest in his or her own life, and therefore can select anyone as a  
beneficiary.  
< previous page page_243 next page >  
 
< previous page page_244 next page >  
Page 244  
2. parent and child, husband and wife, brother and sister have an insurable interest in each other because of blood or  
marriage.  
3. creditor-debtor relationships give rise to an insurable interest. The creditor can be the beneficiary for the amount of  
the outstanding loan, with the face value decreasing in proportion to the decline in the outstanding loan amount.  
4. business relationships give rise to an insurable interest. An employee may insure the life of an employer, and an  
employer may insure the life of an employee. See also BENEFITS OF BUSINESS LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE  
(KEY PERSON INSURANCE): KEY EMPLOYEE (KEY MAN); PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH  
INSURANCE.  
Insurable interest must exist at the inception of the contract, not necessarily at the time of loss. For example, because a  
woman has an insurable interest in the life of her fiance, she purchases an insurance policy on his life. Even if the  
relationship is terminated, as long as she continues to pay the premiums she will be able to collect the death benefit  
under the policy.  
INSURABLE INTEREST: PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE  
1. owner of property has an insurable interest because of the expectation of monetary loss if that property is damaged or  
destroyed.  
2. creditor of an insured has an insurable interest in property pledged as security.  
Insurable interest has to exist both at the inception of the contract and at the time of a loss. For example, an insured can  
purchase a homeowners policy because of insurable interest in a home. Upon selling it, the insured no longer has an  
insurable interest because there is no expectation of a monetary loss should the home burn down.  
INSURABLE RISK condition in which an applicant has met an insurance company's standards. Requirements include a  
loss that is (1) definable; (2) fortuitous; (3) one of a large number of homogeneous exposures; and (4) carries a premium  
reasonable in relation to a potential loss.  
INSURABLE VALUE see INSURABLE RISK.  
INSURANCE mechanism for contractually shifting burdens of a number of PURE RISKS by pooling them.  
INSURANCE AGENT representative of an insurance company in soliciting and servicing policyholders. An agent's  
knowledge concerning an insurance transaction is said to be the knowledge of the insurance company as well. Wrongful  
acts of the agent are the responsibility of the company; these bind the company to the customer. Notice given by an  
insured to the agent is the same as notice to the company. See also AGENT; CAPTIVE AGENT; INDEPENDENT  
AGENT.

INSURANCE AND SOCIETY phrase referring to constructive relationship, in which insurance provides society with  
benefits such as security, savings, encouragement of investment, and reduction in prices of goods to consumers.  
INSURANCE BROKER representative of an insured, not of an insurance company. Acts of a broker are not the  
responsibility of the company, and notice given by an insured to a broker is not the same as notice to the company. The  
broker searches the insurance marketplace for a company in which to place the insured's business for the most coverage  
at the best price. The broker is not restricted to placing business with any one company.

INSURANCE COMPANY, CHOOSING AN consideration should be given to a company's capacity to underwrite a  
particular risk, as indicated by its financial standing, claims philosophy, price structure, agent representation, loss  
prevention and reduction services, and risk analysis expertise. Information can be gained in several ways:  
1. Reputationa prospective insured can fairly easily learn something about an insurance company through business and  
professional associates (lawyer, accountant, banker), through conversations with others in the same field, and by  
discussions with agents and brokers.  
2. Financial capacitylarger businesses and public libraries often have up-to-date reference books, such as Best's  
Insurance Reports (available in Life-Health and Property-Casualty editions) giving detailed analyses of hundreds of  
companies.  
3. State Insurance Departmentinformation about specific insurance companies may be available from the insurance  
departments located in state capitals.  
INSURANCE COMPANY DEPARTMENT see INSURANCE COMPANY ORGANIZATION.  
INSURANCE COMPANY FLEET see FLEET OF COMPANIES.  
INSURANCE COMPANY (INSURER) organization that underwrites insurance policies. There are two principal types  
of insurance companies: mutual and stock. A mutual company is owned by its policy-owners, who elect a board of  
directors that is responsible for its operation. A stock company is owned by its stockholders. In a mutual company,  
profits take the form of policy dividends, or refunds of part  
< previous page page_245 next page >  
 
< previous page page_246 next page >  
Page 246  
of premiums paid, which are distributed to policyowners. Profits in a stock company take the form of stockholders  
dividends, which are distributed to stockholders.

INSURANCE EXPENSES costs associated with FIRST-YEAR EXPENSES, CLAIMS EXPENSES,  
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, and RENEWAL EXPENSES.  
INSURANCE FIELDS see SOCIAL INSURANCE.  
INSURANCE FORM attachment to a property and casualty policy that makes it operative. For example, the Standard  
Fire Policy remains inoperative until a form such as the Buildings and Contents Form is attached.  
INSURANCE FRAUD PREVENTION ACT legislation that makes insurance fraud a federal crime. This act is part of  
the Omnibus Crime Bill. Under the act, it is a federal crime to embezzle or misappropriate funds, money, or premiums  
from an insurance company, to knowingly file false financial information with regulators, to obstruct the investigation  
of an insurance regulator, and to work or allow such work in an insurance field after conviction of a felony involving  
dishonesty.  
INSURANCE FUTURES futures contracts (legally binding contract that stipulates that delivery of an ASSET will be  
taken or delivery of an asset will be made at a future time at an agreed upon price at the current moment) on insurance  
lines to include CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE FUTURES, automobile insurance futures, homeowners insurance  
futures, and so forth, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Traditionally, precious metals such as gold and  
silver; agriculture commodities such as cattle, corn, and soy beans; and United States Treasury issues such as bonds and  
bills, have all been traded on the CBOT. The aim of the transaction with these futures is to cancel the contract with a  
gain before the delivery of the commodity. (Who would want cattle delivered to their house?) On the other hand, the  
insurance futures contract concerns itself with the dollar value the market attaches to an index. In turn, this index is an  
expectation of how much of the premium income generated by a particular line of insurance will have to be allocated to  
pay off incurred losses. For example, if the automobile insurance line generates an income of $5,000,000 and the market  
has an expectation that 90% of that income will have to be allocated to paying off incurred losses, the market will value  
that futures contract at a price somewhat less than $450,000. This is because of such factors that have to be accounted  
for as incurred but not reported losses (IBNR).  
INSURANCE GUARANTY ACT law, in several states, establishing a fund to guarantee benefits under policies issued

INTEREST RATE CAP upper limit on the maximum possible interest rate an insurance company will pay. If the  
market interest rates are below that maximum, the insurance company pays the market interest rate. In this way, the  
insurance company can hedge its interest rate exposure (risk that interest rates will rise or fall at some stipulated time),  
reflected by changes in the value of its assets on the balance sheets.  
INTEREST RATE CHANGE RISK one of four types of risks used by the SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES (SA) to  
determine a life insurance company's overall risk profile when fluctuations in interest rates result in abnormal cash  
inflows or outflows causing positive or negative investment implications. See also ASSET DEPRECIATION RISK;  
GENERAL BUSINESS RISK; INTEREST RATE CHANGE RISK; PRICING INADEQUACY RISK.  
INTEREST RATE COLLAR combination of an INTEREST RATE CAP and an INTEREST RATE FLOOR, creating a  
band within which interest rates can range. For example, if an interest rate band is between 6% and 10%, the insurance  
company does not receive or pay a continuous stream of interest payments from or to another party within this band.  
Above the upper limit on the maximum possible interest rate an insurance company will pay, and below the lower limit  
of the maximum possible interest rate an insurance company will pay, the insurance company and another party will  
exchange interest payments.  
INTEREST RATE FLOOR lower limit on the maximum possible interest rate an insurance company will pay. If the  
market interest rates are below that lower limit, the insurance company pays the lower limit rate. In this way, the  
insurance company can hedge its interest rate exposure (risk that interest rates will rise or fall at some stipulated time),  
reflected by changes in the value of its assets on the balance sheets.  
INTEREST RATE RISK investment risk associated with the possibility that there is a rise in the interest rates after a  
fixed income security has been purchased resulting in a decline in that security's price. The longer the maturity date of  
that security, the greater the exposure of the security's price to interest rate fluctuations. The fluctuations in interest rates  
can have a dramatic effect on the insurance company's bond portfolio.  
INTEREST RATE SCENARIO set of yield curves in which an interest rate is specified for various maturities such as  
monthly, quarterly, or annually. The basis of the interest rate can be corporate bond rates, United States Treasury Issues,  
Commercial Mortgage Rate, or other fixed interest rate instruments. Since the assets and liabilities of pension plans and  
insurance companies are interest-rate sensitive, it is important to be aware of possible future interest rate movements.  
INTEREST RATES, GUARANTEED/EXCESS circumstances in life insurance in which, although a minimum rate is  
guaranteed, a  
< previous page page_253 next page >  
 
< previous page page_254 next page >  
Page 254  
policyowner may earn additional (excess) interest, depending on the company's investment return. See also CURRENT  
ASSUMPTION.  
INTEREST RATE SWAP contractual agreement between two parties in which they agree to exchange a stream of  
interest payments on either a fixed rate for a floating rate or a floating rate for a fixed rate. The insurance company is  
most likely to select a floating rate for a fixed rate because it needs to know exactly what it will be paying in future  
interest. In this way, the insurance company can hedge its interest rate exposure (risk that interest rates will rise or fall at  
some stipulated time), reflected by changes in the value of its assets on the balance sheet.  
INTEREST SENSITIVE CASH FLOW ANALYSIS measurement of the response of the cash flow of an insurance  
company to various interest rate scenarios; for example, how rising interest rates will affect the number of life insurance  
policies surrendered and thus the cash flow.  
INTEREST SENSITIVE POLICIES a newer generation of life insurance policies that are credited with interest  
currently being earned by insurance companies on these policies.  
INTERGOVERNMENTAL POOLS tool of RISK MANAGEMENT used for risk financing by local governments. The  
technique is for many local governments to combine resources in order to SELF INSURE a particular line of business,  
such as general liability, automobile, and WORKERS COMPENSATION. Above the RETENTION level, there is the  
collective purchase of REINSURANCE for the required excess coverage.  
INTERINSURANCE CLAIM SERVICE ORGANIZATION type of organization of property and casualty insurance  
companies whose objective is to share information on fraudulent claims, handle claims in an expeditious manner, and  
disseminate public information concerning safeguarding of property. Some interinsurer organizations are the  
AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION (AIA) Index Bureau, INSURANCE CRIME PREVENTION  
INSTITUTE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT INSURANCE ADJUSTERS (NAII), and  
NATIONAL AUTOMOBILE THEFT BUREAU.  
INTERINSURANCE COMPANY CLAIMS those claims that arise when two or more property and casualty insurance  
companies have coverage on a loss. Which company then owes which portion of the claim must be determined. See also

INTERMEDIATE POLICY INSURANCE POLICY that combines the characteristics of a DEBIT INSURANCE policy  
with that of an ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE policy. These policies were historically sold by the DEBIT AGENT.  
INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN method used to determine the POLICYHOLDER'S return on premiums paid into a  
life insurance policy. This method is illustrated in two ways:  
1. Surrender of Policy Approachcalculation of the interest rate required for the accumulated value of the total premiums  
paid (minus any DIVIDENDS) into the policy at a given time to equal the CASH SURRENDER VALUE of the policy  
at that time;  
2. DEATH BENEFIT Paid Approachcalculation of the interest rate required for the accumulated value of the total  
premiums paid (minus any dividends) into the policy at a given time to equal the death benefit of the policy at that time.  
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE federal statute defining the federal tax code, covering such topics as credits against tax;  
business-related credits; computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property; computation of taxable  
income; definition of gross income, adjusted gross income, and taxable income; itemized deductions; pensions, profitsharing,  
and stock bonus plans; taxation of estates and trusts; taxation of life insurance companies, capital gains and  
losses; and other areas.  
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE: SECTION 303 STOCK REDEMPTION PLAN portion of the federal tax code  
outlining the procedure by which a corporation cancels or redeems its shares with funds paid out of earnings or profits,  
thus making the distribution a taxable dividend.  
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE: SECTION 501 (c) portion of the federal tax code that determines which organizations  
are exempt from federal income taxation. These are generally nonprofit corporations, funds, and foundations for  
education, religious, charitable, or scientific purposes; civic leagues for general social welfare; fraternal beneficial  
societies, orders, or associations; and others.  
INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEE BENEFIT NETWORK agreement among insurance companies through which a  
multinational employer is permitted to purchase employee benefits coverages for two or more of its overseas  
subsidiaries under a single master policy. This working arrangement (network) may be composed of several overseas  
independent insurance companies, may consist of a cooperative agreement between a U.S. insurance company and an  
overseas insurance company,  
< previous page page_255 next page >  
 
< previous page page_256 next page >  
Page 256  
or may be administered by an insurance company that has several subsidiary companies overseas. Employee benefits  
provided through these multinational networks include life, health, pensions, disability income, and accidental death.  
Such a network pools the loss experiences of a particular employer's overseas subsidiaries. If the pooled loss experience  
is better than that expected through the premium charged, a dividend is paid to the employer. However, if the loss  
experience is worse than that expected through the premium charged, three courses of action are available: (1) the  
adverse loss experience is charged to the employer's account with any negative balance shifted to the following lossexperience  
year; (2) the adverse loss experience is absorbed by the insurance companies in the network, and any  
negative balance is not shifted to the following loss-experience year; (3) the adverse loss experience is charged to the  
employer's account with any negative balance shifted to the following loss-experience year, and a contingency fund is  
established with annual contributions against which future adverse loss experiences can be charged. The pooling effect  
allows the employer's adverse loss experience in one country to be offset by better than expected loss experience in  
another country.  
INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE INSURANCE transactions conducted across national boundaries. Such transactions  
occur when the insurance company sells insurance outside the country of the company's domicile.

INTERNET immense collection of networks that are interconnected on a global basis providing services to the general  
public. These services include the transferring of files among computers, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) involving  
the reading and interpreting of hypertext files (web pages) that contain pictures and sounds, and operating computers  
from distant locations. Computers use telephone lines, optical fibers, and radio transmissions to connect networks  
thereby forming Internets. Thus, the Internet is really a super highway along which information travels to the electronic  
address of its destination computer. Along the way this information may pass through computer network to computer  
network several times before reaching its electronic address.

INTERPLEADER legal procedure through which a court determines the rightful claimant (of two or more claimants  
making the same claim) against a third party. Insurance companies use interpleader if claims are made by different  
parties. For example, upon the death of an insured, two or more individuals (such as the widow and a former wife) may  
contest the beneficiary's rights. The insurance company will deposit the policy proceeds with the court until it decides  
on the ownership.  
INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION ENDORSEMENT certificate of insurance required by law under the  
auspices of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The endorsement is attached to all INLAND MARINE policies

property being transported.  
INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) federal agency that regulates commerce across state lines. The  
ICC does not oversee insurance, which is subject to regulation by the states according to Public Law 15, McCarran-  
Ferguson Act. However, insurance companies must comply with many federal laws and regulations.

INVESTMENT AND VALUATION OF ASSETS see INVESTMENTS AND REGULATION.  
INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 act that regulates the variable dollar insurance products (equity related)  
sold by insurance companies. The act includes regulations that stipulate: (1) the variable dollar insurance products must  
be funded through a separate account (segregated from the other investment accounts of the insurance company); (2)  
benefits and cash values must vary in tandem with the investment returns of this separate account; (3) mortality and  
expense fluctuations (above the maximum chargeable stipulated in the policy) must be borne by the insurance company;  
(4) maximum sales load; and (5) periodic financial reports must be sent to the POLICYOWNER.  
INVESTMENT EARNINGS OF INSURANCE COMPANY investment income. Insurance companies invest part of  
their premiums that are not immediately needed for claims and administrative expenses. These earnings are critical to an  
insurance company. A property and casualty company depends on investment earnings to balance under-writing losses.  
A life company depends on the investment earnings to help build policy cash values.  
INVESTMENT EXPENSES expenses associated with the investment of the company's assets to include such items as  
transaction and research costs.  
INVESTMENT GENERATION METHOD DIVIDEND paid to POLICYHOLDER according to the time period in  
which the policy was sold and the investment return the insurance company made on that policy during that time period.  
See also THREE-FACTOR CONTRIBUTION METHOD.  
INVESTMENT INCOME earnings by an insurance company from dividends on its equity portfolio, rent from real  
estate and other property it owns, and interest on its bond holdings.  
INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK RATIO ratio of the insurance company's investment in common stocks  
dividend to its ADJUSTED SURPLUS account. This ratio shows how vulnerable the company's surplus is to the stock  
market fluctuations.  
INVESTMENT IN JUNK BONDS RATIO ratio of the company's investment in noninvestment grade bonds dividend  
to its ADJUSTED SURPLUS. This ratio shows how vulnerable the company's surplus is to the market fluctuations in  
noninvestment grade bonds. The lower this ratio, the more financially sound the insurance company.

INVESTMENT RISK possibility of a reduction in value of an insurance instrument resulting from a decrease in the  
value of the assets incorporated in the investment portfolio underlying the insurance instrument. This reduction can also  
be effected by a change in the interest rate.  
INVESTMENTS money expended with the object of profit. The goal of an insurance company is to invest in assets  
with a rate of return greater than that to be paid out as benefits under its policies. Traditionally, life insurance companies  
have invested in long-term financial instruments such as mortgages. Today, under CURRENT ASSUMPTION life  
insurance policies, investments are in short-term financial instruments. Property and casualty insurance companies,  
because of the nature of their policies, favor short-term financial instruments as investments.  
INVESTMENTS AND REGULATION  
Life insurance:  
1. Bondsmost state regulations permit life insurance company investments in debentures, mortgage bonds, and blue chip  
corporate bonds.  
2. Stocks(a) preferred stock investment is limited to 20% of the total stock of any one company, not exceeding 2% of a  
company's admitted assets; (b) common stock investment is limited to the lesser amount of 1% of the ADMITTED  
ASSETS or the policyowner's surplus.  
3. Mortgageinvestment is unlimited in first mortgages on residential, commercial, and industrial real estate.  
4. Real Estateinvestment is limited to 10% of admitted assets.  
Valuation of the assets in a typical state is accomplished in the following manner: (1) stocks or bonds in default  
(principal or interest) cannot be valued at greater than market value; (2) bonds not in default valued according to their  
purchase price adjusted to equal par at maturity; (3) preferred and common stocks of firms in good financial condition  
are valued according to purchase price; (4) preferred and common stocks in companies not in good financial condition  
are valued at market price; and (5) real estate, mortgages, and policy loans are valued at book value.  
Property and casualty insurance:  
1. DOMESTIC INSURERS and FOREIGN INSURERS must invest according to the minimum capitalization  
requirement in federal, state, or municipal bonds.  
2. Company funds in excess of minimum capitalization and reserve requirements can be invested in federal, state, or  
municipal bonds as well as stocks or real estate. The insurance company is limited in its investment in any one firm up  
to no more than 10% of its admitted assets; its real estate investment can be no more than 10% of its admitted assets.

IRA see INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT.  
IRREVOCABLE something that cannot be changed. In life insurance, a beneficiary who has been named as irrevocable  
cannot be changed without his or her formal (written) permission.  
IRREVOCABLE BENEFICIARY see BENEFICIARY CLAUSE.  
IRREVOCABLE LIFE INSURANCE TRUST ESTATE PLANNING device used so that any life insurance policies  
that are owned by and paid to the TRUST will avoid ESTATE TAX upon the death of the INSURED, and, upon the  
death of the insured's spouse, estate taxes will be avoided as well. The requirement of this trust are: (1) it must be  
irrevocable; and (2) no distributions of the trust's principal or income can be made to the insured. All income generated  
by the trust must be accumulated and then distributed along with the trust's principal to the trust's beneficiary(s). The  
methods of operation of this trust could include the following forms:  
1. Trustee (insured's spouse) has the right to distribute income generated by the trust as well as the principal of the trust  
to the insured's spouse as long as the insured lives. The trustee also has the right to borrow on the CASH VALUE of the  
life insurance policies on the life of the insured owned by the trust and then distribute the funds so obtained to the  
insured's spouse as long as the insured is alive.  
2. Trustee (cannot be insured) has the right to distribute income generated by the trust and/or principal of the trust to the  
insured. The trustee also has the right to borrow on the cash value of the life insurance policies on the life of the insured  
owned by the trust and then distribute the funds so obtained to the insured.  
3. SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE policy is established within the trust with the insured's spouse having  
ownership rights to the cash value part of the split dollar policy and the trust having ownership rights to the death  
benefit minus the cash value. Through this mechanism, the insured's spouse has access to the cash value while the  
insured is alive. Upon the death of the insured and insured's spouse, the amount of the death benefit minus the cash  
value will not be subject to estate tax.

IRREVOCABLE LIVING TRUST TRUST in which rights to make any changes therein are surrendered permanently  
by the GRANTOR. The grantor uses this type of trust to transfer assets and any potential depreciation out of his or her  
estate in order to avoid FEDERAL ESTATE TAX on the second estate distributions to heirs, as well as to avoid  
PROBATE expenses. The primary disadvantage of this type of trust is that the grantor surrenders all control over the  
assets and the right to change the terms of the trust. See also ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION; REVOCABLE

JOINT INSURANCE see JOINT LIFE AND SURVIVOR INSURANCE; JOINT LIFE AND SURVIVORSHIP  
ANNUITY; JOINT LIFE ANNUITY; JOINT LIFE INSURANCE.  
JOINT LIFE AND SURVIVOR INSURANCE coverage for two or more persons with the death benefit payable at the  
death of the last of those insured. Premiums are significantly lower under joint life and survivor insurance than for  
policies that insure only one person, since the probability of having to pay a death claim is lower.  
JOINT LIFE AND SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY ANNUITY that continues income payments as long as one annuitant,  
out of two or more annuitants, remains alive. For example, a married couple would receive an income for as long as  
both spouses are alive. Thereafter, payments would continue as long as the surviving spouse is alive, usually for a  
smaller amount. This type of annuity is ideal for a husband and wife in that it guarantees the surviving spouse an  
income for life. Even with a LIFE ANNUITY CERTAIN or other type of refund annuity, it is possible for a surviving  
spouse to outlive the money that has been funding the annuity. See also ANNUITY.  
JOINT LIFE ANNUITY retirement plan in which income payments continue until the death of the first of two or more  
annuitants. This type of annuity is not appropriate for a husband and wife since at the death of the first spouse income  
payments cease. The monthly benefit is greater than with other annuities since income payments cease at the first death.  
See also ANNUITY.  
JOINT LIFE INSURANCE coverage of two or more persons with the death benefit payable at the first death. Premiums

KEETON-O'CONNELL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE PLAN early type of no-fault automobile insurance developed  
by two law professors, Robert Keeton and Jeffrey O'Connell. Its basic premise is that for many accidents it is  
impossible to place the blame as required by the tort legal system. In this approach, each individual would be able to  
collect from his or her own insurance company without having to prove fault on the part of anyone.  
KENNEY RATIO proposal by Roger Kenney, an insurance journalist, that in order to maintain the solvency of a  
property and casualty insurance company, insurance premiums written should not exceed more than twice the  
company's surplus and capital. This historical measure is used by regulators to determine a property and casualty  
company's capacity to make claim payments while maintaining its solvency.  
KEOGH PLAN (HR-10) act first passed in 1962 that permits the self-employed individual to establish his or her own  
retirement plan. This individual can make nondeductible voluntary contributions and tax-deductible contributions  
subject to a maximum limit of 25% of earned income up to $30,000 for a defined contribution plan after the reduction  
for the contribution to the Keogh Plan. This is an equivalent rate of 20% of earned income prior to the contribution to  
the Keogh Plan.  
KEY EMPLOYEE INSURANCE see BENEFITS OF BUSINESS LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE (KEY  
PERSON INSURANCE); KEY EMPLOYEE (KEY PERSON).  
KEY EMPLOYEE (KEY PERSON) individual who possesses a unique ability essential to the continued success of a  
business firm. For example, this individual might have the technical knowledge necessary for research and development  
of products that keep the company at the cutting edge of its field. The death or disability of this key individual could  
severely handicap the company. See also BENEFITS OF BUSINESS LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE (KEY  
PERSON INSURANCE).  
KEY EMPLOYEES, INSURANCE PLANS FOR typical NONQUALIFIED PLANS of life insurance for key  
employees include:  
1. PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCEdividends generated by the policy are used to pay the income tax of the key  
employee that results from the premiums paid by the employer on the permanent insurance policy. For federal tax  
purposes the employer-paid premiums are taxed as additional earned income for the employee. Under the better  
permanent policies, after the policy has been in force a few years the dividends should exceed the taxable premium  
income to the employee. The advantages of permanent insurance to the key employee include life insurance coverage  
for life, increasing cash values, increasing dividends selection of beneficiary, and owner-ship of policy.  
< previous page page_265 next page >  
 
< previous page page_266 next page >  
Page 266  
2. TERM LIFE INSURANCEpremiums paid by the employer are considered federal taxable income to the employee.  
Employee selects beneficiary and owns policy. Policy probably will not remain in force after retirement because the  
premiums continue to increase in cost and become prohibitive.  
3. SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCEpermanent life insurance is purchased on the life of the employee. Premium  
payments are split between the employee and the employer. The employer has an equity interest in the cash value of the  
policy to the extent of the premium payment he or she has paid in. The employee has an equity interest in the cash value  
of the policy to the extent that the cash value exceeds the premiums paid in by the employer. Under the better  
permanent policies, the cash values will accumulate to a substantial sum, whereupon the employer can withdraw from  
the cash value an amount equal to his or her premium paid in. At this point the split dollar plan is said to terminate, and  
the employee has sole possession of the policy. The cash values remaining should be sufficient so that no further  
premium payments are required by the employee to keep the policy in force.  
4. SALARY CONTINUATION PLANemployer usually purchases permanent life insurance on the life of the employee,  
is the beneficiary of the policy, and owns the policy. If the employee dies before receiving all promised supplemental  
pension benefits, the employer will pay the remaining supplemental pension benefits to the beneficiary of the deceased  
employee. Funds for payments are provided from the life insurance proceeds.  
5. Death Benefit Only Life Insurance Planemployer usually purchases permanent life insurance on the life of the  
employee, is the beneficiary of the policy, and owns the policy. Premiums paid by the employer are not considered  
federal taxable income to the employee. Upon the death of the employee, the employer will use the life insurance  
proceeds to pay death benefits for several years to the employee's beneficiary. The employer receives the life insurance  
proceeds tax free; however, the death payments to the employee's beneficiary are federal taxable income to that  
beneficiary. This plan can also be utilized to supplement the employee's pension plan at retirement.  
KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS theory, named after the British economist John Maynard Keynes, that deals with current  
consumption at the expense of saving. This theory has important implications for life insurance products and annuities  
since their purchase requires foregoing a portion of current consumption in favor of savings and future financial  
security. See also ANNUITY; SAVINGS ELEMENT, LIFE INSURANCE.

LADDERING purchasing bond investments that mature at different time intervals.  
LADDER PORTFOLIO method of investing that staggers the maturities of a group of bonds. As a bond matures, the  
investor can reinvest the proceeds in either short-or long-term bonds depending on the interest rate and economic  
environment at that time. For example, if interest rates are rising, the matured bond's proceeds can be invested in longer  
term, higher yielding bonds. As interest rates decline, higher interest rates would have already been locked in through  
the previous purchase of higher yielding bonds. As bonds continue to mature in a falling interest rate environment, the  
proceeds can be invested in bonds of shorter maturities, thereby having liquidity for future investment in longer  
maturity bonds if interest rates increase.  
LAG time that has elapsed between when claims actually occurred and when claims are actually paid.  
LAND OWNERSHIP, USE AND POSSESSION OF liability exposure, in insurance, associated with three  
classifications of individuals that may come upon an insured property:  
1. TRESPASSERindividual enters without permission. Generally the insured has no legal obligation to render his or her  
land safe for the trespasser, but the insured cannot create a death trap.  
2. LICENSEEindividual enters with permission, but there is no mutual profit motive involved. Generally, the insured's  
only obligation to the licensee is to warn of any hidden dangers of which the insured is aware.  
3. INVITEEindividual expressly or by implication is invited to enter property; there is a mutual profit motive.  
Generally, the insured must use reasonable care to render his property safe for the invitee's visit.

< previous page page_268 next page >

Page 269  
2. in life insurance, termination of a policy because of failure to pay a premium and lack of sufficient cash value to  
make a premium loan.  
LAPSED POLICY see LAPSE.  
LAPSE RATIO percentage of a life insurance company's policies in force at the beginning of the year that are no longer  
in force at the end of the year. This ratio is critical because it indicates the rate at which policies are going off the books  
and the resultant loss of earnings to the company.  
LAPSE RISK measure of the sensitivity of the insurance company's liability to changing policy surrender distributions.  
LAPSE SUPPORTED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES policies that have their future cash values closely correlated with  
a high LAPSE RATIO of the insurance company's BOOK OF BUSINESS. In theory, gains resulting from these lapses  
will result in a greater SURPLUS ACCOUNT, thereby building the future cash values of these policies. In essence, the  
policy is specifically designed so that if it is surrendered, its SURRENDER VALUE would be less than its ASSET  
SHARE VALUE.  
LARGE LOSS PRINCIPLE transfer of high severity risks through the insurance contract to protect against catastrophic  
occurrences. While insurance is generally not the most cost-effective means of recovery of minor losses, an insured  
cannot predict catastrophes and thus set aside enough money to cover losses on a mathematical basis or to self-insure.  
Actuarial tables are based on the large loss principle: the larger the number of exposures, the more closely losses will  
match the probability of loss. In essence, a large number of insureds, each paying a modest sum into an insurance plan,  
can protect against the relatively few catastrophes that will strike some of their numbers.  
LAST CLEAR CHANCE common law rule of negligence that imposes liability on an individual who had one last  
opportunity to avoid an accident but did not take it. An example is a driver who could have avoided hitting another  
automobile by applying his brakes but did not do so. One reason for not avoidingor even causingan accident is a desire  
to collect insurance proceeds.  
LAST SURVIVOR ANNUITY see JOINT LIFE AND SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY.  
LAST SURVIVOR INSURANCE coverage of two or more individuals with the death benefit payable at the last death.  
Premiums are significantly lower than for policies that insure one person, since the probability of having to pay a death  
claim on the second death is lower.  
LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS mathematical premise stating that the greater the number of exposures, (1) the more  
accurate the prediction; (2) the less the deviation of the actual losses from the expected losses (X - x approaches zero);  
and (3) the greater the credibility of the prediction (credibility approaches 1). This law forms the basis for the statistical  
expectation of loss upon which premium rates for insurance  
< previous page page_269 next page >  
 
< previous page page_270 next page >  
Page 270  
policies are calculated. Out of a large group of policyholders the insurance company can fairly accurately predict not by  
name but by number, the number of policyholders who will suffer a loss. Life insurance premiums are loaded for the  
expected loss plus modest deviations. For example, if a life insurance company expects (x) 10,000 of its policy-holders  
to die in a particular year and that number or fewer actually die (X), there is no cause for concern on the part of the  
company's actuaries. However, if the life insurance company expects (x) 10,000 of its policyholders to die in a  
particular year and more than that number dies (X) there is much cause for concern by actuaries.  
LAW OF MORTALITY premise that, out of a large group of people, a given number will die each year (conversely, a  
given number will remain alive each year) until all the people in that original group are dead. This life and death event  
will allow the LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS to operate effectively.  
LAWYERS (ATTORNEYS PROFESSIONAL) LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage if a lawyer's professional act (or  
omission) results in the client inflicting bodily injury or property damage to another party, or if personal injury and/or  
property damage is incurred by a client who brings an action for injuries and or damages suffered. The policy also  
provides for defense costs, legal fees, and court costs of the defendant, even if the suit is without foundation.  
LAYERING combination of several policies with each adding an additional layer or limit of coverage above the limits  
of the policy that comes before it. For example, Policy A adds $100,000, then Policy B adds $200,000 and then Policy  
C adds $300,000, for a total of $600,000. In some instances a business firm cannot obtain the total coverage it requires  
from a single insurance company. Thus, the business may have to buy several policies from different companies in  
order to acquire the total needed.  
LAY UNDERWRITER home office underwriter who evaluates risk based on probability, statistics, and medical  
knowledge.  
LEAD INSURER insurance company that puts together a consortium of insurance and reinsurance companies to  
provide an adequate financial base with sufficient underwriting capacity to insure large risks. Usually the lead insurer  
will take a large percentage of the risk for its own account.  
LEASE use of another party's property in exchange for rental payment. See also LEASEHOLD INSURANCE;  
LEASEHOLD PROFIT INTEREST; LEASEHOLD VALUE INTEREST.  
LEASEHOLD see LEASE.  
LEASEHOLD INSURANCE coverage for a tenant with a favorable lease (enabling the lessee to rent premises for less  
than the market value). If the lease is canceled by the lessor because an insured peril  
< previous page page_270 next page >  
 
< previous page page_271 next page >  
Page 271  
(such as fire) strikes, the lessee is indemnified for the loss incurred. The premise is that the lessee will have to forgo  
earnings derived from having an advantageous lease, and should be indemnified for this incurred loss.  
LEASEHOLD PROFIT INTEREST difference between the rent received by a lessee for the subletting property and the  
rent the lessee pays the lessor.  
LEASEHOLD VALUE INTEREST difference between the rent paid by a lessee as fixed by a lease prior to destruction  
of property and the rent received by the lessor after that property has been restored.  
LEDGER COST see LIFE INSURANCE COST.  
LEGACY SALE utilization of life insurance to make annual gifts into a trust in order to produce the largest tax-free  
death benefit possible to the trust beneficiaries.  
LEGAL see LEGAL PURPOSE; LEGAL RESERVE; LIABILITY, LEGAL.  
LEGAL EXPENSE INSURANCE prepaid legal insurance coverage plan sold on a group basis. Entitles a group  
member to a schedule of benefits, at a stipulated premium, for adoptions, probates, divorces, and other legal services.  
This emerging employee benefit has had wide acceptance in some localities but limited acceptance elsewhere. After  
scheduled benefits have been exhausted, subsequent legal fees are usually based on the attorney's customary rate. For  
example, a prepaid legal insurance plan may provide only three legal consultations a year.  
LEGAL LIABILITY see LIABILITY, LEGAL.  
LEGAL LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY see LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
LEGAL PLAN group arrangement in which a network of attorneys provides legal services to the participants in the plan  
with the attorney fees being reimbursed by the provider. The attorneys who are members of the network provide their  
legal services at a reduced rate from their customary fee to the plan participants. Most legal plans are voluntary on the  
part of the employees with the employees paying their entire cost through PAYROLL DEDUCTION INSURANCE.  
There are two main types of group legal plans:  
1. Access plansparticipants in the plan receive legal advice for such matters as simple wills, and demand letters plus  
other legal advice over the telephone.  
2. Comprehensive plansparticipants in the plan receive legal advice through office and telephone consultations for such  
concerns as wills, trusts, bankruptcy, civil litigation, real estate transactions, and other general legal planning.

LEGATEES individuals who inherit ASSETS as the result of being named in a WILL.  
LEMON AID INSURANCE property and casualty coverage that indemnifies automobile dealers if a dissatisfied  
customer demands a refund within the period of time allowed under the Uniform Commercial Code. This insurance is  
not widely sold today because of the increase in recalls of vehicles for inherent defects.  
LENDER ESTATE V. COMMISSIONER legal decision wherein proceeds of a life insurance policy on which the  
decedent's corporation paid the premiums within three years of his or her death are not includable in the decedent's  
gross estate, as affirmed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.  
LENDERS HOLDER-IN-DUE-COURSE INSURANCE coverage that indemnifies a third party lender if a customer  
refuses to repay a loan made on a faulty product and the dealer who arranged the loan refuses to correct the fault. This  
coverage has gained new importance as more customers are refusing to repay loans on products with inherent defects.  
LEVEL uniformity. See also COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE, LEVEL COMMISSION; LEVEL PREMIUM  
INSURANCE; LEVEL TERM INSURANCE.  
LEVEL COMMISSION compensation in which an insurance agent's fee for the sale of a policy is the same year after  
year. Most life insurance companies pay a high first year commission and lower commissions in later years. This  
commission structure is controversial since critics feel that it is heavily weighted towards selling a product at the  
expense of subsequent service.  
LEVEL PERCENTAGE OF COMPENSATION see DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.  
LEVEL PREMIUM premium that remains unchanged over time, regardless of any change in the nature of the risk.  
LEVEL PREMIUM GROUP ANNUITY type of PREMIUM PLAN under which the employer (if  
NONCONTRIBUTORY plan) or the employer and employee (if CONTRIBUTORY plan) make level annual premium  
payments to fund the future retirement benefits of the employee, through a GROUP DEFERRED ANNUITY, plus a  
GROUP LIFE INSURANCE policy on the employee, usually held in the trust.  
LEVEL PREMIUM INSURANCE coverage in which premiums do not increase or decrease for as long as the policy  
remains in force. In the early years of a policy, the premiums are greater than is necessary to pay mortality costs. The  
excess is used to build the cash value and to provide for the increasing mortality costs later in the life of the policy.

LEVEL TERM INSURANCE coverage in which the face amount of a policy remains uniform, neither increasing nor  
decreasing for as long as the policy is in force.  
LEVERAGED SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE modified collateral SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE plan  
under which the employee purchases and owns a life insurance policy on the employee's own life. The employer makes  
the unscheduled premium payments on the policy. The employee makes a collateral assignment of the policy to the  
employer, which acts as security for the unscheduled premiums paid by the employer. Upon this assignment, the life  
insurance company that issued the policy lends the employer the amount of the unscheduled premium payment; interest  
paid the insurance company by the employer for the loan is tax-deductible to the employer. Part of this interest paid by  
the employer is credited to the cash value of the policy by the insurance company. During this period of time, the  
employer is also making the scheduled premium payments due on this policy (at least seven annual premium payments  
must be made if the policy is to retain its tax-advantaged status). The scheduled premium payments are taxed as  
ordinary current income to the employee. When the employee retires, the split dollar plan is terminated and all of the  
unscheduled premium payments made by the employer are repaid to the employer, either through loans on the cash  
value of the policy or through cash withdrawals from the policy. With the repaid premiums amount, the employer then  
repays the insurance company for the previous loans made to pay the unscheduled premium payments. The repaid loan  
amount is credited to the cash value of the policy by the insurance company. From the reconstituted cash values, the  
employee then borrows a series of annual income payments based on the employee's life expectancy. When the  
employee dies, the DEATH BENEFIT from the policy repays the amount owed the insurance company for the loans  
from the cash value made to fund the retirement income of the employee. The excess amount (if any) of the death  
benefit minus the policy loan repayment is paid to the BENEFICIARY(S) of the employee.  
LIABILITIES: LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES future benefits to be paid to the policyholders and beneficiaries,  
assigned surpluses, and miscellaneous debts. These primary liabilities take the form of reserves, which must be listed on  
the company's balance sheet as part of the liabilities section. The valuation of a company's reserves, which guarantee  
that funds will be available to meet its liabilities, is strictly regulated by the state insurance departments. Life insurance  
company liabilities also include cash surrender values of its policies and annuities.  
LIABILITY legal obligation to perform or not perform specified act(s). In insurance the concern is with the  
circumstance in which (1) one party's property is damaged or destroyed, or (2) that party incurs bodily injury as the  
result of the negligent acts or omissions of another

omissions, even if the suit is without foundation.  
LIABILITY, CIVIL DAMAGES AWARDED three types of damages can be awarded to a plaintiff:  
1. Special Damagesreimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, including medical bills, legal charges, cost of repairing  
damaged or destroyed property, and loss of current and projected income.  
2. General Damagesreimbursement for damages that do not readily lend themselves to quantitative measurement,

AWARDED.  
LIABILITY: LIMITATIONS ON INSURERS exceptions to coverage. There is no obligation for an insurance company  
to pay a claim if:  
1. the loss is not covered by a policy, or a particular person is not included in the definition of the insured.  
< previous page page_275 next page >

2. the loss takes place outside the territorial coverage of the policy. For example, there is no coverage under the  
PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) outside the United States and Canada.  
3. the loss takes place after the policy has expired.  
4. the insured involved in the loss was in violation of public law; for example, an insured's car that is damaged as the  
result of his transporting drugs.  
5. the insured is in violation of contract law.  
6. the limit of coverage under the policy is not sufficient to cover a loss.

LIABILITY, PERSONAL EXPOSURES acts or omissions that result in suits against an individual and/or residents of  
the individual's household for actual or imagined bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. Exposures  
include:  
1. ownership, use, and possession of property concerning: (a) trespassthe obligation is not to render property safe for a  
trespasser, but one cannot create a death trap or maintain an attractive nuisance, such as a swimming pool, without  
proper safeguards; (b) licenseethe obligation is not to render property safe for a licensee but to provide adequate  
warning of any hidden dangers such as quicksand at the side of an approach road; (c) invitation the obligation is to  
render the property safe for an invitee's visit. For example, if someone trips on a throw rug, the owner or occupier of the  
premises can be held liable.  
2. ownership, use, and possession of a motorized vehicle on or off premises.  
3. involvement in sports.  
4. actions of pets.  
LIABILITY, PROFESSIONAL liability created when an individual who offers services to the general public claims  
expertise in a particular area greater than the ordinary layman. Today, suits are frequently brought alleging that a  
professional, such as a physician, attorney, or CPA, has committed negligent acts or omissions in performing the  
purchased service. For some professions, such as medical specialties, it has become impossible to purchase professional  
liability insurance at a reasonable price. Premiums have become prohibitive because of the frequency and severity of  
both reasonable and unreasonable professional liability suits.

such expanded coverage.  
LICENSE in insurance, legal authority obtained by an insurance company, agent, broker, or consultant that permits  
them to do business in a particular state. The document issued by the state shows that the company or person is in  
compliance with the various governing laws and thus is authorized to conduct insurance business in that jurisdiction. A  
license, in and of itself, is not a guarantee that a consumer will be sold the best product to fit his or her needs or that an  
agent will have the proper technical expertise to evaluate the products on a consumer's behalf.  
LICENSE, AGENTS see LICENSING OF AGENTS AND BROKERS.

LICENSED CARRIER insurance company that is organized under the state laws by which the company is licensed and  
that is called a DOMESTIC INSURER. Also, this insurance company may be chartered and licensed in another state or  
country and has obtained a license to conduct business in that particular state.  
LICENSEE individual permitted to enter property with the permission of the owner or the person who controls the  
property. There is no mutual profit motive; the licensee comes onto the property for his or her sole benefit. For example,  
the owner of land gives an individual permission to hunt on the property but does not charge a fee. The owner must  
warn the licensee of any hidden dangers on the property of which he or she is aware.

LICENSE FEE sum paid by an insurance company or other firms or individuals to designated types of business in a  
particular state or municipality.  
LICENSING OF AGENTS AND BROKERS legal authority granting individuals the right to conduct insurance  
business in a particular state. In many states, agents and brokers must pass a written exam as a prerequisite to being  
licensed. In others, a professional designation such as the CLU or CPCU can be substituted for the examination  
requirement. The caliber of examinations varies from state to state. A license is usually issued for one or two year  
periods, and then must be renewed.  
LIEN action brought by a worker or creditor for failure to receive payment for labor and material provided. Property  
insurance is available for individuals with an insurable interest in property against which they may bring a lien.  
LIFE AND HEALTH, BUSINESS EXPOSURES loss of a key person due to death, disability, sickness, resignation,  
incarceration, or retirement. Because of the expertise of such an individual, there could be a loss of income, market  
share, research and development advantage, and line of credit by the firm. Also, there are extra expenses associated with  
training a replacement for a key person. Coverage for many of these exposures is available under key person life and  
health insurance. See also BUY AND SELL AGREEMENT.  
LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PARTNERSHIP see PARTNERSHIP, LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE.  
LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE, PERSONAL AND FAMILY EXPOSURES personal and family loss by death,  
disability, sickness, old age, accident, and unemployment. All of these exposures are insurable, and coverages can be  
purchased under a variety of policies. In life insurance these include ADJUSTABLE LIFE, CURRENT ASSUMPTION,  
ENDOWMENT, FAMILY INCOME POLICIES, FAMILY MAINTENANCE POLICIES, FAMILY POLICY,  
LIMITED PAYMENT LIFE, TERM LIFE, UNIVERSAL LIFE, and VARIABLE LIFE. In annuities, both fixed and  
variable types are available; in health insurance, medical expense and disability income coverages are available. In  
pensions, there are DEFINED BENEFIT and DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION plans. The various Social  
Security benefits also provide considerable protection against personal and family exposures.  
LIFE ANNUITY see ANNUITY.  
LIFE ANNUITY CERTAIN ANNUITY guaranteeing a given number of income payments whether or not the annuitant  
is alive to receive them. If the annuitant is living after the guaranteed number of payments have been made, the income  
continues for life. If the annuitant dies within the guarantee period, the balance is paid to a beneficiary. For example,  
under one common contract, a life annuity certain for 10 years, income payments are guaranteed for a minimum of 10  
years. If the annuitant  
< previous page page_278 next page >  
 
< previous page page_279 next page >  
Page 279  
dies after receiving two years of payments, the beneficiary would receive the remaining eight years of income. An  
annuitant who lives out the 10 years would receive income payments for life, but there would be none available to a  
beneficiary.

asked before joining a community include:  
1. Who sponsors the community?  
2. What is the financial condition of the community?  
3. Is the community accredited?  
4. Who are the trustees?  
5. Does the community provide educational and recreational opportunities?  
6. May the residents of the community have visitors and pets and under what circumstances?  
7. Who makes the rules for the community and to what extent are the members allowed to contribute?  
8. What legal rights do the members have to the assets of the community?  
LIFE ESTATE see ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION.  
LIFE EXPECTANCY probability of one's living to a specific age according to a particular mortality table. Life  
expectancy is the beginning point in calculating the pure cost of life insurance and annuities and is reflected in what is  
known as the BASIC PREMIUM. The probability of living longer has continued to increase in the U.S., and thus the  
pure cost of insurance continues to decrease. This is reflected in a declining premium rate. Increasing life expectancy is  
critical to the cash value projection in CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS life insurance products, such as universal life  
insurance and variable life insurance.  
LIFE EXPECTANCY TERM INSURANCE type of TERM LIFE INSURANCE policy that has a FACE AMOUNT  
that increases to a predetermined sum and then decreases to zero at the termination point of the policy, while at the same  
time generating a CASH VALUE. The number of years that the term policy will be in force is determined by the  
average LIFE EXPECTANCY for the age and sex classification in which the prospective insured falls.  
LIFE INCOME annuity payments that continue for the life of the annuitant. See also ANNUITY.  
< previous page page_279 next page >  
 
< previous page page_280 next page >  
Page 280  
LIFE INCOME POLICY policy that has many similar characteristics to that of the SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY in that  
the ANNUITANT receives a predetermined monthly income benefit for life upon the death of the INSURED. The  
annuitant's LIFE EXPECTANCY as well as the insured's life expectancy must be taken into consideration when  
determining the premium; thus, the annuitant cannot be changed after having been selected. The essential difference  
between this policy and the survivorship annuity is that under this policy a minimum number of payments are  
guaranteed to be paid after the insured's death, regardless of whether or not the annuitant is alive to receive them. If the  
annuitant does not survive the guarantee period (PERIOD CERTAIN), a contingent annuitant will receive the remaining  
guaranteed monthly income payments.  
LIFE INCOME WITH PERIOD CERTAIN annuity payments that continue for the life of the annuitant; should the  
annuitant not survive a stated period, the payments are then made to a beneficiary until the stated period ends.  
LIFE INSURANCE protection against the death of an individual in the form of payment to a beneficiaryusually a  
family member, business, or institution. In exchange for a series of premium payments or a single premium payment,  
upon the death of an insured, the face value (and any additional coverage attached to a policy), minus outstanding policy  
loans and interest, is paid to the beneficiary. Living benefits may be available for the insured in the form of surrender  
values or income payments. See also ADJUSTABLE LIFE INSURANCE; ENDOWMENT INSURANCE; FAMILY  
INCOME POLICY; FAMILY INCOME RIDER; FAMILY MAINTENANCE INSURANCE; LIMITED PAYMENT

LIFE INSURANCE COST amount paid to an insurer. Determination of the actual cost (not the price paid) of a life  
insurance policy has been widely discussed for many years in life insurance and consumer circles. The traditional or net  
cost method (that adds a policy's premiums, and subtracts dividends, if any, and cash value) does not consider the TIME  
VALUE OF MONEY. The LINTON YIELD METHOD, a theoretical approach, attempted to remedy this by comparing  
a cash value policy with a combination of decreasing term insurance and the yield of a side fund of bonds and other  
investments. Other methods have been proposed. At present many states require prospective insureds to be given  
INTEREST-ADJUSTED COST figures that do take into consideration the time value of money. This method is not  
altogether practical for  
< previous page page_280 next page >  
 
< previous page page_281 next page >  
Page 281  
INTEREST SENSITIVE POLICIES, but it is generally felt that present work toward a new approach will eventually  
result in a useful means of comparing the costs of these policies.  
LIFE INSURANCE, CREDITOR RIGHTS protection given to life insurance beneficiaries by state laws, under which  
the benefits of a life insurance policy usually cannot be attached by creditors of an insured and/or beneficiary. These  
laws are based on philosophical concerns dating back to the founding of the U.S., and the Homestead Laws that a  
widow and children should not be made to pay for the financial sins of the father.

LIFE INSURANCE ILLUSTRATION QUESTIONNAIRE form whose purpose it is to help the agent and the  
prospective policyowner judge the validity of the insurance company's policy illustrations. This questionnaire's focus is  
on the nonguaranteed elements of the policy and how these nonguaranteed elements compare with the company's  
current experience. Some of the questions this questionnaire seeks to answer include:  
1. To what degree are the mortality rates in the illustration reflective of the true mortality rates that the company is  
currently experiencing?  
2. To what degree are the interest rates in the illustration reflective of the true interest rates that the company is currently  
experiencing? Upon what is the interest rate to be based (new money or portfolio average)?  
3. To what degree are the expense charges in the illustration reflective of the true expense charges that the company is  
currently experiencing? Are these expense charges significantly understated in the illustration?  
4. To what degree are the persistency rates in the illustration reflective of the true persistency rates that the company is  
currently experiencing? Are these persistency rates significantly understated in the illustration, thereby increasing policy  
cash value?  
LIFE INSURANCE ILLUSTRATIONS MODEL REGULATION regulation set forth by the NATIONAL  
ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) to govern life insurance sales illustrations. Includes the  
following major provisions:  
1. POLICYOWNER must be provided an annual report of the policy status if illustrations were used in conjunction with  
selling the policy.  
2. An agent must sign the illustrations with copies furnished to the insurance company and the policyowner.  
3. The COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE must be notified by the insurance company if a policy is to be sold with or  
without illustrations.  
< previous page page_281 next page >  
 
< previous page page_282 next page >  
Page 282  
4. Illustrations' nonguaranteed elements cannot be more favorable than the lesser of the currently payable scale or the  
disciplined current scale as defined by law.  
5. Specific format guidelines must be followed by the illustrations.  
6. Illustrations must contain a narrative summary and a numerical table, as well as tabular details.  
7. The regulation applies to all individual life, group life, and certificate life policies with the exceptions of individual  
and group annuities, variable life, credit life, and those life policies whose death benefits are less than $10,000.  
8. The board of directors of the insurance company is required to appoint an illustration actuary who must certify on an  
annual basis that the illustrations meet the requirements of the regulation.

LIFE INSURANCE PROGRAMMING process used to determine the amount of life insurance required on the life of  
the prospective insured. The process involves an analysis of the prospective insured's current financial condition  
(income, expenses, liquid and nonliquid assets, liabilities, savings, and investments), the financial objectives of the  
POLICYOWNER, the development and installation of a plan designed to achieve these objectives, and the periodic  
monitoring of the plan to determine the extent to which the plan is achieving the objectives. See also ESTATE

LIFE REINSURANCE system whereby a life insurance company (the reinsured) reduces its possible maximum loss on  
either an individual life insurance policy (FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE) or a large number of life insurance  
policies (AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE) by giving (ceding) a portion of its liability to another insurance company  
(the reinsurer). See also REINSURANCE.  
LIFE RISK FACTORS information needed for underwriting a life insurance policy, such as an applicant's age, weight,

LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (LLC) company in which shareholders limit their liability exposure to their  
percentage of ownership or equity interest in the company. Shareholders' personal assets are protected in the event of  
business-related lawsuits. The tax situation for this type of company is much like that of the partnership in that it acts as  
a pass-through tax entity. A tax return for a partnership is filed with the IRS for information purposes only. All income  
and expenses are attributed to the stockholders of the LLC. According to the LLC agreement, the stockholders can  
allocate income and its resultant tax liability the same way as partners in a partnership.  
The LLC has advantages over the subchapter ''S" corporation to include the following: (1) LLC has no restriction on  
number of persons who may be stockholders; "S" corporations are limited to 35 stockholders; (2) LLC may have  
multiple classes of stock; an "S" corporation can have only one issue of stock; and (3) LLC may own subsidiaries; an  
"S" corporation cannot own subsidiaries.  
LIMITED PAYMENT LIFE INSURANCE type of policy with premiums that are fully paid up within a stated period.  
For example, a 20-payment life insurance policy has 20 annual premium payments, with no further premiums to be paid.  
LIMITED POLICY type of health insurance providing benefits for only a particular peril, such as cancer.  
LIMITED POLLUTION LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM commercial liability insurance form providing coverage for  
an insured business in the event of a pollution liability suit. The insurance provides CLAIMS MADE BASIS

LIMITS UNDER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS (LUMP) single limit insurance program remaining in force for several  
years as compared with traditional insurance programs where there is a series of annual limits. The LUMP insurance  
program is most effective in those instances where the statistical analysis shows low-frequency, short-tail (length of  
time elapsed between the act giving rise to the claim and when the claim is recognized or reported to the insurance  
company) risks that have a potential for catastrophic loss. LUMP insurance programs provide insurance coverages for  
such exposures as marine liability, directors and officers liability, general liability, and workers compensation.

LINES OF INSURANCE, MAJOR five primary sectors of insurance coverage. Their purposes are:  
1. LIFE INSURANCEprovides income to a beneficiary in the event of the death of the insured.  
< previous page page_286 next page >  
 
< previous page page_287 next page >  
Page 287  
2. HEALTH INSURANCEprovides two types of coverage: (a) Medical Expense, which indemnifies an insured for  
hospital, physician, and related expenses; (b) Disability Income, which provides a source of income for an insured in the  
event of partial or total disability. It is generally felt that this source of income should approximate at least 50% of  
earnings prior to a disability.  
3. ANNUITYprovides monthly income to an annuitant for life.  
4. PROPERTY INSURANCEindemnifies an insured for damages or destruction of property.  
5. LIABILITY INSURANCEcovers damages on behalf of an insured who becomes legally obligated to pay because of  
actual (or alleged) negligent acts and omissions.  
LINTON YIELD METHOD interest adjusted method that measures the cost of life insurance. Named for the late  
distinguished actuary M. Albert Linton. This method compares a whole life policy with a combination of a decreasing  
term policy and a side fund. The rate of return of the side fund is called the Linton Yield, in that it brings the side fund  
up to an amount equal to the cash value of the whole life policy after a specified period of time.  
LIQUIDATION AND REHABILITATION taking over of an insurance company's assets by the State Insurance  
Commissioner when examination of the annual report reveals that the company is in substantial financial difficulty. The  
State Insurance Commissioner will then operate the company in what is deemed to be the best interest of the  
policyowners, insureds, and creditors. If the State Insurance Commissioner believes it is possible to save the company,  
rehabilitation (reorganization of the company's structure) may be ordered; if salvage is deemed impossible, liquidation  
may be necessary.  
LIQUIDATION CHARGE amount subtracted from an annuity or from mutual fund proceeds payable to an annuity  
owner or mutual fund owner to reflect expense fees described in the annuity contract or mutual fund prospectus. This  
charge may be viewed as a penalty for cashing in the annuity or mutual fund early. This fee is meant to dis-courage  
early withdrawal of funds and/or to enable the company to recoup its expenses associated with marketing,  
administering, and liquidating the product.  
LIQUIDATION PERIOD time frame during which an annuitant receives income payments from the insurance  
company, usually on a monthly basis. The obligations of the company to the annuitant during the liquidation period  
depend on whether it is a pure or refund annuity. For the PURE ANNUITY, all payments cease upon the death of the  
annuitant. For the REFUND ANNUITY, a beneficiary is usually entitled to payments upon the death of the annuitant.  
LIQUIDITY see LIQUIDITY OF ASSETS.  
< previous page page_287 next page >  
 
< previous page page_288 next page >  
Page 288  
LIQUIDITY OF ASSETS financial holdings that can be converted into cash in a timely manner without the loss of  
principal, such as U.S. Treasury Bills. Liquidity of assets is one of the most important principles of investment  
strategies, especially the first layer of an investment portfolio. Life insurance is generally placed in this first layer  
because of its cash value. The owner has complete liquidity since it can be used as collateral for a loan a any time.  
LIQUOR LIABILITY LAWS legislation that makes an establishment and/or individual selling liquor responsible for  
injuries caused by its customers to third parties. The best known law governing dispensation of liquor on premises is the  
DRAM SHOP LAW. For example, an individual is served liquor at an establishment and becomes intoxicated. On his  
way home he or she causes an accident, injuring another party. The injured third party can bring a liability suit against  
the establishment that dispensed the liquor for injuries suffered.  
LIVE ANIMAL INSURANCE coverage under the Commercial Property Floater for loss under two forms:  
LIVESTOCK MORTALITY LIFE INSURANCE and LIVESTOCK FLOATER. This is really life insurance coverage  
for livestock.  
LIVESTOCK FLOATER standard Commercial Property Floater form covering death or damage to livestock as the  
result of insured perils such as fire, lightning, explosion, smoke, wind, hail, aircraft, earthquake, theft, flood, collapse of  
bridges, collision, or overturn of a vehicle used in transporting the livestock from the point of destination. Some  
insurance companies also cover attacks by domestic or wild animals, drowning, and accidental shooting. Common  
exclusions include illegal acts, confiscation by the order of a government authority, loss due to quarantine, war, loss due  
to sleet or snow, and loss due to the acceptance by the owner of a check covered by insufficient funds.  
LIVESTOCK INSURANCE coverage for designated horses and other farm animals if they are damaged or destroyed.  
The insurance includes registered cattle and herds, other farm livestock, and zoo animals. This type of insurance  
protects the farmer or rancher against the premature death of animals resulting from natural causes, fire, lightning,  
accidents, and acts of God, acts of individuals other than the owner or employees, and destruction for humane purposes.  
LIVESTOCK MORTALITY (LIFE) INSURANCE coverage that provides a death benefit to the owner of a policy in  
the event of the death of insured livestock.  
LIVESTOCK TRANSIT INSURANCE coverage in event of damage or destruction of animals that are being shipped.  
LIVING still with life. This is a life insurance term used to describe the living benefits available under a life insurance  
policy such as a monthly retirement payment to an insured.  
< previous page page_288 next page >  
 
< previous page page_289 next page >  
Page 289  
LIVING BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE benefits provided to and obtained by those insured, while still alive. They  
include the ANNUITY, CASH SURRENDER VALUE, DISABILITY INCOME (DI), POLICY LOAN, and WAIVER  
OF PREMIUM (WP).  
LIVING DEATH BENEFITS early payout of anticipated death benefits from a RIDER attached to an existing policy or  
from a separate policy. The purpose is to allow the terminally ill insured an additional source of finance to pay medical  
bills and/or nice-to-have items. There are basically two methods for paying out these benefits: (1) the policy-holder  
gains access to the benefits when the policyholder contracts an illness that has been diagnosed as terminal with a life  
expectancy usually of less than two years; (2) the policyholder gains access to the benefits when the policyholder is  
confined to a nursing home or a long-term care facility and can be expected to remain in this facility until death.  
Generally, as long as the POLICYHOLDER is expected to die within 12 months of the date of the payment of the living  
death benefit, and that benefit is discounted only by an amount that is consistent with a life expectancy no greater than  
one year in duration, the beneficiary(s) is not taxed on the life insurance proceeds.  
LIVING TRUST see ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION.  
LIVING WILL legal document that permits the individual to declare his or her desires concerning the use of lifesustaining  
treatment to be made at the point in time when death is imminent and the individual no longer has control of  
his or her faculties. This type of will has the advantages of ensuring that the individual's wishes are followed to the  
conclusion and that a family member does not have the burden of making extremely agonizing decisions on behalf of  
the individual. It is the requirement of most state statutes that such a will be signed, dated, and witnessed (excluding  
anyone who has an interest in the estate of the individual affirming the will). Also required by most state statutes is that  
the will include both a statement of capacity and a statement of intent by the individual. The following states have  
statutes addressing the living will issue: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,  
Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,  
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,  
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, as well as Washington, D.C. See also

LLOYD'S OF LONDON insurance facility composed of many different syndicates, each specializing in a particular  
risk; for example, hull risks. Lloyd's provides coverage for primary jumbo risks as well as offering REINSURANCE  
and RETROCESSIONS. Membership in a syndicate is limited to individuals with a large personal net worth, and each  
member may belong to one or more syndicates depending upon his or her net worth. Although much of the publicity  
Lloyd's receives involves insuring exotic risks such as an actress' legs, this represents only a very small portion of its  
total business, most of which involves reinsurance and retrocessions.  
LLOYD'S REGISTER OF SHIPPING classification of ships according to their construction material, age, physical  
condition, propulsion type, stress tests of structure, and owners. Marine insurance rates for a particular vessel are based  
on these demographics. Lloyd's register is used worldwide by government agencies and industry to track and identify  
vessels. In many instances the country of registration is of strategic importance if a vessel is exposed to attack, say, in  
the Middle East and in other danger points in the world.  
LLOYD'S SYNDICATE group of underwriters with LLOYD'S OF LONDON who specialize in underwriting a  
particular risk such as hull insurance.  
LLOYD'S UNDERWRITER individual member of one of the syndicates of LLOYD'S OF LONDON.  
LOADING addition to the pure cost of insurance that reflects agent commissions, premium taxes, administrative costs  
associated with putting business on an insurance company's books, and contingencies.  
LOAN money that is lent. In life insurance, a loan can be taken against the cash value of a life insurance policy at any  
time. The policyholder does not have to repay the loan until the policy matures or until the loan and any outstanding  
interest equals the cash value.  
LOAN RECEIPT acknowledgment by the POLICYOWNER that he or she has received the POLICY LOAN requested.  
LOAN VALUE amount that a policyowner can borrow from a cash value of a permanent life insurance policy.  
LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LANs) systems composed of personal computers linked by a file server. These  
computers share software as well as databases that enable the risk manager access to information in a quick and efficient  
manner. For example, in Workers' Compensation claims the risk manager can quickly analyze claims data and pinpoint  
the exact area of the company's operations that is responsible for the most severe injuries incurred by the workers.  
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSISTANCE NETWORK (LGEAN) clearinghouse and forum of  
information concerning the environment used by local governments. Included in the

LOCATION CARD insurance record showing the amount of INSURANCE coverage placed on any one location.  
LOCK-IN PRINCIPLE accounting rule found under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that  
prohibits the insurance company from restating assumptions that it made for interest earned, expenses paid, and  
mortality charges for policies in force.  
LOCK-IN RATE commitment that a lending institution makes to offer a loan at a stipulated interest rate at a  
predetermined future time, usually limited to 90 days.  
LODGE SYSTEM OF INSURANCE see FRATERNAL LIFE INSURANCE.  
LONDON INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE MARKET ASSOCIATION (LIRMA) association that represents  
reinsurance companies as well as insurance companies that do not market MARINE INSURANCE. LIRMA and the  
INSTITUTE OF LONDON UNDERWRITERS share the same facility for processing policies and claims.  
LONDON INSURANCE MARKET NETWORK (LIMNET) computer system established by London trade  
associations for processing insurance policies. The work of LIMNET involves the notification and settlement of  
insurance policy claims.  
LONGSHOREMEN AND HARBOR WORKERS ACT LIABILITY coverage under the Workers Compensation Act  
for all employees in the maritime industry who perform their function in navigable U.S. waters, including dry docks,  
wharves, piers, and other places for docking. Excluded are the master and crew of the ship, and any individual involved  
in loading, unloading, or repairing of a ship whose weight is less than 18 tons.  
LONGSHOREMEN AND HARBOR WORKERS ENDORSEMENT extension of a Workers Compensation and  
Employers Liability Insurance policy to cover workers who go aboard ship to perform their jobs. See also WORKERS  
COMPENSATION BENEFITS; WORKERS COMPENSATION, COVERAGE B.  
LONG-TAIL LIABILITY one where an injury or other harm takes time to become known and a claim may be separated  
from the circumstances that caused it by as many as 25 years or more. Some examples: exposure to asbestos, which  
sometimes results in a lung disease called asbestosis; exposure to coal dust, which might cause black lung disease; or  
use of certain drugs that may cause cancer or birth defects. These long-tail liabilities became very expensive for many  
corporations in the 1970s and 1980s, also causing problems for insurers because it was unclear when the situation that  
gave rise to the claim  
< previous page page_291 next page >  
 
< previous page page_292 next page >  
Page 292  
happened and who should pay the claim. One theory, the MANIFESTATION/INJURY THEORY, states that the insurer  
is responsible whenever the disease is diagnosed. The other view, the OCCURRENCE/INJURY THEORY, states that  
the insurer must pay only when the person is injured.  
LONG-TERM CARE (LTC) day-to-day care that a patient (generally older than 65) receives in a nursing facility or in  
his or her residence following an illness or injury, or in old age, such that the patient can no longer perform at least two  
of the five basic activities of daily living: walking, eating, dressing, using the bathroom, and mobility from one place to  
another. There are basically three types of LTC plans:  
1. Skilled nursing care provided only by skilled medical professionals as ordered by a physician. MEDICARE will pay  
a limited amount of the associated cost.  
2. Intermediate care provided only by skilled medical professionals as ordered by a physician. This care involves the  
occasional nursing and rehabilitative assistance required by a patient.  
3. Custodial care provided only by skilled medical professionals as ordered by a physician. The patient requires  
personal assistance in order to conduct his or her basic daily living activities.  
When selecting a LTC policy, some of the more important considerations include:  
1. Renewabilitypolicy should be a GUARANTEED RENEWABLE CONTRACT.  
2. Waiting periodlength of time before benefits are paid should not exceed 90 days.  
3. Age eligibilityupper age limit should be at least 80.  
4. Length of time benefits are paidtypically the range is 5 to 10 years. It would be preferable to have benefits paid for  
life.  
5. Inflation guardthe benefit level should be automatically adjusted each year according to the increase in the costs  
charged by the long-term-care providers.  
6. Premium waiverafter the patient has received benefits for at least 90 days, the patient is no longer required to make  
premium payments for as long as he or she is under long-term care.  
7. No increase of premiums with agepremiums should be based on the age at the time of application and should never  
increase as a result of changes in age.  
8. No limitations for preexisting conditionsthere should be no PREEXISTING CONDITION limitations.  
LONG-TERM DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE coverage that provides monthly income payments for as long as  
an insured remains disabled. The insurance policy defines the nature of the disability it covers. Most policies  
discontinue income payments beyond age 65. See also DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE.  
LONG-TERM INSURANCE insurance written for a period of time greater than one year.

LOSS damage through an insured's negligent acts and/or omissions resulting in bodily injury and/or property damage to  
a third party; damage to an insured's property; or amount an insurance company has a legal obligation to pay.  
1. a company is legally obligated to pay the least of the following amounts: (a) amount of the loss; (b) limits of  
coverage; (c) amount resulting from the application of the coinsurance formula, such that  
where Insurance Required = Value of Property x Coinsurance  
For example, assume that the insured had a $200,000 home destroyed totally by fire; carried $150,000 in insurance  
coverage; and there was an 80% coinsurance requirement. Then, according to the formula  
(d) amount according to the pro rata distribution clause. If there is more than one insurance policy covering the  
damaged or destroyed property, each policy will pay no more than its proportionate share of the loss. In the foregoing  
example, if the insured had two separate $200,000 policies, each would pay no more than $100,000.  
2. questions regarding loss coverage include: Is the peril covered? Is the property covered? Is the person covered? Is the  
policy in force? Are the limits of coverage adequate? Is the location covered? Has the hazard been increased?  
3. steps an insured should take: (a) send written notice immediately to the insurance company or its agent; (b) do  
everything reasonable to protect the property from further damage; (c) separate damaged from undamaged property; (d)  
provide the insurance company with a written inventory of damaged or destroyed property; (e) submit within 60 days  
following the loss written proof of the loss; and (f) make the damaged or destroyed property available for examination  
by the insurance company.  
LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE cost involved in an insurance company's adjustment of losses under a policy.  
LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES amount of the insurance company's liabilities for claims  
that have not been settled. If this reserve increases significantly in relation to the company's SURPLUS, the risk is  
greater for potential deficiencies in the reserves; that is, the reserves could prove to be inadequate to meet future claim  
payments.

LOSS CARRYBACK ruling that, under current tax law, if an insurance company is to use a LOSS CARRYFORWARD  
accounting adjustment, the company must first offset a net income loss in a specified time period against a net income  
gain in the three preceding years.  
LOSS CARRYFORWARD ruling that, under current tax law, an insurance company that has incurred a net income loss  
in a given year may charge that loss against its taxable income in a subsequent year. This accounting adjustment may be  
made provided that the insurance company first offsets its net income loss in a given period against its net income gain  
in the three preceding years, or thus adopts a loss carry-back accounting procedure.  
LOSS CLAUSE feature of property and casualty policy providing coverage without a reduction in the policy's limits  
after a loss is paid. For example, if the limit of coverage under a property policy is $100,000 and a loss of $50,000 is  
paid, the limit still remains $100,000. Thus, the total amount of coverage in force for future losses is $100,000. In the  
absence of a loss clause, the total limit of coverage is reduced after payment of a loss.  
LOSS CONSTANT surcharge, in retrospective rating of property and liability insurance, added to the BASIC  
PREMIUM rate charged to reflect fixed cost of adjusting or settling losses.

LOSSES INCURRED important quantitative measure for an insurance company indicating the percentage of each  
premium dollar that is going to pay for losses. Based on losses incurred, appropriate reserves are established. Changes  
in incurred losses over several policy periods indicate the trend in the loss picture and the accuracy of the basic  
premium charged to reflect expected losses.

LOSS LOADING see LOADING.  
LOSS OF INCOME insured's income prior to the disability minus the insured's income after the disability. See also  
DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE.  
LOSS OF INCOME INSURANCE coverage in property insurance for an employee's lost income if a peril such as fire  
damages or destroys the place of employment, causing the worker to become unemployed. For example, a fire destroys  
a manufacturing plant, and as a result employees are placed on indefinite leave without pay. This coverage would then  
go into effect. In health insurance, loss of income benefits are paid when an insured becomes disabled and cannot work.  
LOSS OF TIME INSURANCE see LOSS OF INCOME INSURANCE.  
LOSS OF USE INSURANCE coverage in the event that property is damaged or destroyed so that an insured cannot use  
the property for its intended purpose. For example, loss of use of a drill press because of vandalism would be covered.  
LOSS PAYABLE CLAUSE coverage for a mortgagee where real or personal property, used as security for a loan, is  
damaged or destroyed. For example, a bank (mortgagee) lends money to an individual (mortgagor) who pledges certain

under the policy for an amount up to the outstanding loan.

LOSS PREVENTION see ENGINEERING APPROACH; LOSS PREVENTION AND REDUCTION.  
LOSS PREVENTION AND REDUCTION risk management control procedure that emphasizes safety management. Its  
purpose is to reduce the frequency and severity of potential losses. Business firms apply this procedure by posting safety  
signs, holding safety meetings, and providing cash awards for employees with the best safety records. See also  
ENGINEERING APPROACH; HUMAN APPROACH.  
LOSS PREVENTION SERVICE see ENGINEERING APPROACH.  
LOSS RATE frequency of losses. See also LOSS FREQUENCY METHOD.  
LOSS RATIO relationship of incurred losses plus loss adjustment expense to earned premiums.  
LOSS RATIO METHOD modification of premium rates by a stipulated uniform percentage for closely related classes  
of property or liability insurance policies. The objective of such modification is to more directly align the combined  
actual loss ratio of the classes of policies under consideration with the expected loss ratio of these classes. The resultant  
alignment should show no significant STANDARD DEVIATION OR VARIATION of the actual loss ratio from the  
expected loss ratio.  
LOSS RATIO RESERVE METHOD formula for a given line of insurance used by property and casualty insurance  
companies to compare losses and loss adjustment expense with premiums. This shows (1) the amount of each premium  
dollar generated that is used to pay losses and expenses, and (2) the reserves that must be maintained to pay for those  
losses and expenses.  
LOSS REDUCTION see LOSS PREVENTION AND REDUCTION.  
LOSS REPORT see CLAIM REPORT.  
LOSS RESERVES provision for known claims due but not paid, known claims not yet due, and provision for  
INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED (IBNR) claims. The critical problem facing a casualty insurance company is the  
amount of reserves necessary for the incurred but not reported losses (IBNR) because many of these claims and their  
resultant settlements may not manifest themselves until several years in the future. This is known as the tail end  
distribution liability. See also FULL PRELIMINARY TERM RESERVE PLAN; PROSPECTIVE RESERVE;

insured must carry  
< previous page page_296 next page >  
 
< previous page page_297 next page >  
Page 297  
insurance on the value of a home on a replacement cost basis of at least 80%. For example, a home is worth $200,000,  
and a fire does $50,000 damage. If there is $150,000 of insurance, it may appear that the insured would be reimbursed  
for the total loss. But the homeowner would receive only $46,875 according to the following formula:  
If, however, the insured had carried an 80% insurance to value of $160,000, then the insured would have been  
reimbursed for the total loss of $50,000 according to the following formula:  
See also COINSURANCE; SETTLEMENT OPTIONS, PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE.  
LOSS SEVERITY see SEVERITY RATE.  
LOSS TRENDS projections of future accidental losses based on analyses of historical loss patterns. A projected loss  
picture is used to determine the pure cost of protection and the resultant basic premium, contingency reserves, and  
whether or not the company should continue selling a given line of business, or remain in a particular geographical area.  
However, loss trends based on historical data may not really represent likely loss outcomes in the future.  
LOSS-YEAR STATISTICS see ACCIDENT-YEAR STATISTICS.  
LOST-INSTRUMENT BOND indemnification bond under which a stock certificate holder who loses the original  
certificate will be issued a duplicate. The indemnity bond guarantees that if the original stock certificate is recovered,  
the holder will send it to the surety company.  
LOST POLICY RECEIPT life insurance company form to be signed by a policyholder who wishes to surrender a policy  
that has been lost. The signed receipt then becomes evidence that the policy is no longer in force. This protects the  
insurance company if a policyholder claims that the policy was never surrendered.  
LOST POLICY RELEASE see LOST POLICY RECEIPT.  
LOUISIANA OMNIBUS PREMIUM REDUCTION ACT (NO PAY, NO PLAY LAW) law that places limitations on  
an uninsured motor vehicle owner or motor vehicle operator's ability to recover damages in the event of a motor vehicle

If there is a motor vehicle accident and the motor vehicle owner or operator does not have the minimum liability  
insurance or other evidence of the ability to pay in force, the owner/operator is prohibited from recovering the first  
$10,000 in property damage and the first $10,000 in bodily injury damage. This prohibition also applies if the  
CLAIMANT does not have liability insurance or other forms of security covering the motor vehicle.

After the limits of coverage have been exhausted under a basic plan, major medical then covers medical expenses  
relating to room and board; physician fees; miscellaneous expenses such as bandages, operating room expenses, drugs,  
X-ray, and fluoroscopy. There may be a lifetime limit. For example, if the lifetime limit is $500,000 and an insured uses  
$100,000 of coverage in a given year, the lifetime limit would be reduced to $400,000. See also GROUP HEALTH

example, one company's manual yearly rate per $1000 of life insurance for a given policy for a male age 26 is $12.02.  
See also RATE MAKING.  
MANUFACTURERS AND CONTRACTORS LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for liability exposures that result  
from manufacturing and/or contracting operations in process on a manufacturer's premises (all locations of ongoing  
operations) or, in the case of the contractor, off-premises operation at a construction site. Excluded are activities of  
independent contractors, damage to property by explosion, collapse, and underground property damage. Additional  
coverages apply to the acts of the insured's employees when constructing new structures, demolishing old structures,  
and changing the size and/or location of existing structures.  
MANUFACTURERS OUTPUT INSURANCE coverage for personal property of a manufacturer on an ALL RISKS  
basis when that property is off the manufacturer's premises.  
MANUFACTURING INSURANCE see BUSINESS INCOME COVERAGE FORM.  
MANUSCRIPT INSURANCE coverage tailored to the particular requirements of an insured, when a standard policy  
cannot be used to provide coverage for real or personal property. A manuscript policy is often written on site by an

catastrophe occur, such as a hurricane.  
MARGIN fluctuation in claims arising from ADVERSE SELECTION.  
MARGOLIN ACT legislation passed in California that establishes procedures applicable to any worker who incurs a  
job-related injury. This act has far-reaching implications for WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE in other  
states also. Under the act, the employer must provide the Employee's Claim for Workers Compensation Benefits form  
upon an employee's request or within 1 day of his or her injury. A series of penalties and fines is established in the event  
that claims rightfully due a claimant are inappropriately delayed. For example, one fine could result if indemnity  
payments do not begin within 14 days of the employer's knowledge of an employee's disability. Another fine could  
result if the entire compensability investigation is not completed within 90 days. Attorney's are required to provide  
prospective clients at the initial

MARKETING creation of a demand for a company's products, its distribution, and services for customers who purchase  
that product. Actuarial research and development, underwriting efficiency, and claim payment promptness is of little  
value if no one is willing to purchase insurance products. Agency and marketing departments are the focus of all sales  
activity within an insurance company, and touch every aspect of a company by generating (1) premium income for  
securities, real estate, and mortgage investments; (2) sales for review by the underwriting department and their issuance  
by policyholder services; (3) need for data storage and retrieval by the company's data

company.  
MARKET TIMING investment strategy that advocates the transfer of amounts from one category of investment to  
another category according to a perception of how each of these categories of investments will perform relative to other  
categories of investments at a stipulated point in time. This strategy may be applied by purchasers of the VARIABLE  
DOLLAR ANNUITY or VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE, both of which have provisions for the transfer of sums  
between stock, bond, and real estate accounts.  
MARKET VALUE see MARKET VALUE V. ACTUAL CASH VALUE.  
MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT (MVA) increase or decrease in the SURRENDER CHARGE of the LIFE  
INSURANCE policy or annuity contract depending on the current financial markets. The CASH VALUE is adjusted  
upward if the policy interest rate is greater than the current interest rate on new money and thus, if interest rates decline  
after the insurance policy or annuity contract purchase date, the surrender charge becomes less than that exhibited.  
Conversely, the cash value is adjusted downward if the policy interest rate is less than the current interest rate on new  
money and thus, if interest rates rise after the insurance policy or annuity contract purchase date, the surrender charge  
becomes greater than that exhibited.  
MARKET VALUE CLAUSE provision of property insurance that establishes the amount for which an insured must be  
reimbursed for damaged or destroyed property according to the price a willing buyer would pay for the property  
purchased from a willing seller, as opposed to the ACTUAL CASH VALUE of the damaged or destroyed property. See  
also MARKET VALUE V. ACTUAL CASH VALUE.  
MARKET VALUE v. ACTUAL CASH VALUE value of property as established by the price a willing buyer would  
pay for property purchased from a willing seller, compared with the replacement cost of damaged or destroyed property  
minus depreciation and obsolescence. Usually, replacement cost basis is used in property insurance to indemnify an  
insured for damaged or destroyed property. See also MARKET VALUE CLAUSE.

MASTER-SERVANT RULE assumption that an employer is liable for negligent acts or omissions of employees that  
result in bodily injury and/or property damage to third parties if those acts are in the course of employment.  
MATCHING requiring assets and liabilities of an insurance company to go up or down together on a proportional basis.  
The duration of the asset and liability should be approximately the same. For example, an insurance policy of 12 months  
in duration should be identified with an asset that matures in 12 months. As interest rates go up, thereby requiring the  
insurance company to pay a higher return to its policyholders, the interest earned on investments should go up on a  
proportionate basis.  
MATCHED SET OR PAIR INSURANCE see SET CLAUSE (PAIR OR SET CLAUSE).  
MATERIAL BOND BOND issued to a contractor guaranteeing that the supplier (individual posting the bond) will

MATERIAL FACT see MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION.  
MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION falsification of a material fact in such a manner that, had the insurance company  
known the truth, it would not have insured the risk. A material misrepresentation gives an insurance company grounds  
to rescind a contract. See also CONCEALMENT.

MAXIMUM BENEFIT see BENEFIT FORMULA; COINSURANCE.  
MAXIMUM DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTION limit allowed by law on employee salary reduction plans. Many  
pension plans, as well as the popular 401 (k) plan, allow employees to set aside pre-tax dollars in a company-sponsored  
retirement account, often matched by a company contribution. But the amount contributed by the employee is regulated  
by law. For example, the maximum annual contribution for the 401 (k) plan, which was $30,000 per year in 1986, was  
reduced to $7000 by the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986.  
MAXIMUM FAMILY BENEFIT see COORDINATION OF BENEFITS; GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE.

MEASUREMENT see LOSS DEVELOPMENT; LOSS FREQUENCY METHOD; LOSS TRENDS.  
MEDIAN statistical term indicating the central value of a frequency distribution, such that smaller and greater values  
than this central value occur at an equal rate. For example, given the numbers 1, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 22, the  
median is 14.  
MEDIATION situation in which parties agree to take part in a structured settlement negotiation through the guidance of  
a neutral expert. By participating in this process, the parties do not agree that they will actually settle and the mediator  
does not have the authority to impose such a settlement. The mediation process may be terminated at any time without  
cause by either party. The advantage of this process includes the claimant's ability to have quick settlements, thereby  
enabling the claimant to pay medical bills and to replace lost wages.  
MEDICAID assistance program for the financially needy. Medicaid, also referred to as Title XIX of the Social Security  
Act, was enacted in 1965 at the same time as MEDICARE. It is a joint federal-state program that provides medical  
assistance for the aged, blind, and disabled, and families with dependent children who cannot pay for such assistance  
themselves. Benefits vary widely among the states.  
MEDICAID QUALIFYING TRUST IRREVOCABLE LIVING TRUST (rights to make any changes are forfeited by  
the GRANTOR permanently) in which the grantor forfeits control of all assets placed in the trust. However, the grantor  
retains the right to all income produced by the assets in the trust, and the assets can be distributed to beneficiaries at the  
grantor's death. The objective of this trust is to protect the assets of the grantor against depletion to pay the costs of  
LONG-TERM CARE or against dissipation by the grantor's heirs during the grantor's lifetime.  
MEDICAL see MEDICAL EXAMINATION.  
MEDICAL EXAMINATION physical checkup required of applicants for life and/or health insurance to ascertain if

Shreveport, Louisiana. The MIB was organized to guard against fraud by applicants.  
MEDICAL PAYMENTS INSURANCE provision of liability policies and the liability sections of package insurance  
policies, such as the PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP), that pay medical expenses without regard to fault.  
The insured does not admit liability for bodily injury to another party, nor does an injured party forfeit the right to sue  
the insured.  
MEDICAL PAYMENTS TO OTHERS INSURANCE see HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICYSECTION II

MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS (MSAs) savings accounts that have tax advantages combined with HEALTH  
INSURANCE plans for the benefit of the employee. Both the employee and the employer are permitted to contribute to  
the MSA. The contributions can be directed to pay the deductible under the health insurance plan and/or the medical  
expenses not covered by the health insurance plan. Funds not spent are allowed to accumulate in the MSA on a  
continuous basis. When the employee reaches retirement age, the accumulated funds may be allocated to the employee's  
retirement income. The MSA differs from a FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT (FSA) in one very important respect:  
Under an MSA, funds not used for current health care expenses belong to the employee. Under an FSA, funds not under  
the current health care expenses belong to the employer.

MEDICARE program enacted in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 to provide  
medical benefits to those 65 and over. The program has two parts: Part A, Hospital Insurance, and Part B,  
Supplementary Medical Insurance. Retired workers qualified to receive Social Security benefits, and their dependents,  
also qualify for the hospital insurance portion. The program is paid for by payroll taxes on employees and covered  
workers. The supplementary medical

insurance provides additional coverage on a voluntary basis for physician services. Those enrolled in the program pay a  
monthly premium. Coverage is also available to persons under 65 who are disabled and have received Social Security  
disability benefits for 24 consecutive months.  
MEDICARE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE ACT federal legislation passed in 1988 (repealed November 23, 1989)  
that significantly increased the benefit amounts provided under MEDICARE, both Part A and Part B, in the following  
manner:  
1. Doctors' billseffective January 1, 1990. Medicare patients under Part B would have had their out-of-pocket expenses  
for doctors' bills limited to $1370. However, if the doctor charged more than Medicare approved, the patient would be  
liable for the difference. The patient would have paid the first $75 as a DEDUCTIBLE for the approved charges, and  
Medicare would have paid 80% of the remaining approved charges up to $1370, and 100% of the approved charges  
above $1370. Any payments made by the patient's private insurance would be applied to the $1370.  
2. Hospital billseffective January 1, 1990, Medicare patients would have paid a deductible of $564 per year for the first  
stay in the hospital. After this deductible was paid, Medicare would have paid 100% of all hospital bills regardless of  
the length of stay.  
3. Drugseffective January 1, 1990, Medicare would have begun paying for OUTPATIENT prescription drugs. After the  
patient paid a $550 deductible, Medicare would have paid 80% of the cost of intravenous drugs, to include antibiotics,  
and 50% of the cost of immunosuppressive drugs. Effective January 1, 1991, after the patient paid a $600 deductible  
and a 50% COPAYMENT, Medicare would have paid for most other prescription drugs and insulin. Effective January  
1, 1992, after the patient paid a $652 deductible and a 40% copayment, most prescription drugs would have been  
covered by Medicare. Effective January 1, 1993, and beyond, after the patient paid a deductible yet to be determined  
and a 20% copayment, most prescription drugs would have been covered by Medicare.  
4. Skilled nursing facilityeffective January 1, 1989, after the patient paid a copayment of $22 per day for the first eight  
days, Medicare would have paid for 150 days of skilled nursing facility care.  
5. Home health careeffective January 1, 1990, patients who did not require daily care would have been eligible for up to  
six days a week of home health care for as long as the doctor prescribed.  
6. Hospice careeffective January 1, 1989, terminal patients would have been entitled under Medicare to unlimited  
hospice care.  
7. Respite careeffective January 1, 1990, an individual who was caring for a Medicare patient (provided the patient had  
met either the $1370 Part B limit or the annual deductible for prescription drugs) at home who required daily care would  
have been entitled to 80 hours per year of home health aide and personal care services.

8. Mammographyeffective January 1, 1990, a Medicare patient would have been covered up to $50 for X-ray expenses  
incurred to detect breast cancer.  
The costs to Medicare participants would have been as follows:  
1. Currently, all Medicare Part B beneficiaries must pay an extra $4 premium each month above the normal Medicare  
Part A premium. By 1993, the extra premium would have been $10.20 per month. All individuals who were entitled to  
Part A benefits for more than six months during a tax year and owed at least $150 in federal income taxes would also  
have paid a supplemental premium of 15% for each $150 for 1989, 25% for 1990, 26% for 1991, 27% for 1992, and  
28% for 1993. For tax years starting after 1993, the annual limit would have been tied to increases in the costs of  
Medicare. The maximum supplemental premium would have been $800 per Medicare beneficiary, or $1600 per couple  
enrolled in Medicare for tax year 1989; $850 and $1700, respectively, for tax year 1990; $900 and $1800, respectively,  
for tax year 1991; $950 and $1900, respectively, for tax year 1992; and $1050 and $2100, respectively, for tax year  
1993.  
MEDICARE GAP INSURANCE see MEDICARE; MEDICARE INSURANCE.  
MEDICARE PLUS CHOICE (MEDICARE PART C) part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that permits  
MEDICARE recipients to select coverage among various private health care plans to include HMOS, PPOS, POINTOF- 
SERVICE (POS), MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS (MSA), fee-for-service plans, and provider-sponsored plans.  
These plans will receive a per capita payment per enrollee from the federal government, and the plans have the option to  
charge the enrollees a monthly premium. Persons who are eligible for Medicare Part A and are enrolled in Medicare  
Part B are eligible for enrollment in either the traditional Medicare program or this new Medicare Part C program. Each  
November, the health care financing administration will conduct open enrollment periods so that persons may select the  
type of health care program in which they wish to participate.  
MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTARY INSURANCE see MEDIGAP INSURANCE.  
MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE two basic kinds of policies sold by health insurance companies: (1)  
MEDIGAP INSURANCE (MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTARY INSURANCE); and (2) MEDICARE WRAP-AROUND  
INSURANCE.  
MEDICARE WRAPAROUND INSURANCE insurance that acts as a supplement to MEDICARE in that it will pay the  
DEDUCTIBLES and COINSURANCE sums that the Medicare recipient is responsible for paying. In addition, some  
policies pay amounts for hospital and nursing home expenses after the Medicare limits have been reached.

Page 310  
MEDIGAP INSURANCE (MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTARY INSURANCE) policy designed to act as a supplement to  
Medicare. The supplementation is in the form of additional benefits to that provided by Medicare. The additional  
benefits are in the form of payment for medical expenses incurred but excluded by Medicare's deductibles, by  
limitations on approval medical charges, by limitations on length and type of care in nursing facilities, and by  
limitations imposed by various cost-sharing requirements. Most of these policies pay substantially less than 100% of the  
expenses not covered under Medicare. Insurance companies that sell Medigap policies are required by law to have an  
open enrollment period of six months for those individuals who first enroll in Medicare Part B at age 65 or older.  
Insurance companies can, however, exclude preexisting conditions from the data of initial coverage, but for no more  
than six months. Insurance companies are restricted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to the  
selling of 10 standard Medigap insurance policies. Each policy is mandated to provide a basic amount of benefits.  
MEMBER person covered by insurance under a BLUE CROSS or BLUE SHIELD plan.  
MEMORANDUM CLAUSE provision in ocean marine cargo policies to limit an insurance company's liability for  
partial losses; the company has liability only for losses that exceed a stipulated PERCENTAGE of the value of the cargo.  
MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT OF 1996 act that prohibits insurance companies, group health plans, and HEALTH  
MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS from establishing lifetime limits or annual limits on mental health coverage that  
are lower than the limits on medical coverage. These plans that do not have limits on medical coverage cannot establish  
limits for mental health coverage. Under this act, the employer is not required to offer mental health or substance abuse  
benefits. This act applies to those companies with at least 50 employees and became effective for the plan year  
beginning on or after January 1, 1998.  
MERCANTILE OPEN-STOCK BURGLARY INSURANCE coverage for damage or destruction of property due to a  
crime, and property lost due to a burglary, whether successful or attempted. An endorsement provides coverage for  
robbery and theft of merchandise. Coverage is provided for merchandise, equipment, fixtures, furniture left in the open  
on the business premises. There is a coinsurance basis of 40 to 80%. This policy has generally been replaced by current  
COMMERCIAL CRIME COVERAGE FORMS.  
MERCANTILE ROBBERY INSURANCE coverage available under two forms for actual or attempted robbery of  
money, securities or other property. Under the First Form the policy covers if the robbery is committed on the premises  
of the business. The Second Form covers if the robbery is committed against a messenger of the business off its  
< previous page page_310 next page >  
 
< previous page page_311 next page >  
Page 311  
premises. An endorsement can provide coverage if employees have property of the business in their custody at home,  
and this property is lost through robbery or burglary. This policy has generally been replaced by current  
COMMERCIAL CRIME COVERAGE FORMS.  
MERCANTILE SAFE BURGLARY INSURANCE coverage in the event a safe of a business is forceably entered,  
either on or off the premises, and property is stolen from the safe. Also covered is damage to the premises during actual  
or attempted burglary. Premium rates can be reduced through precautions such as burglar alarms, guards, and other  
protective measures. There is no coinsurance or deductible requirement. This policy has generally been replaced by  
current COMMERCIAL CRIME COVERAGE FORMS.  
MERCHANT MARINE ACT see JONES ACT.  
MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR REORGANIZATION OF PLAN SPONSOR change in the nature of an employer  
or other organization that sponsors a qualified pension plan. A qualified plan must guarantee vested benefits due to  
participants in the event of a merger, acquisition, or change in employer status. For example, the value of benefits  
cannot be reduced as the result of a merger.

exclude benefits for military service-connected perils of death, disability, illness, accident, or sickness. This clause is  
usually canceled with the declaration of peace.  
MILLION DOLLAR ROUND TABLE (MDRT) association of life insurance agents who meet minimum life insurance  
sales standards predetermined each year by the organization. Membership is a primary goal of professional life  
insurance agents, as it denotes personal sales achievement.  
MINIMUM AMOUNT POLICY see MINIMUM BENEFIT.  
MINIMUM BENEFIT smallest face amount of life insurance that an insurance company will write on any one person.  
MINIMUM CONTINUATION PREMIUM smallest PREMIUM necessary to keep the life insurance policy in force  
regardless of the current mortality, interest, and expense experience of the insurance company. This type of premium is  
usually associated with UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE.  
MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION see MINIMUM PREMIUM PLAN.  
MINIMUM DEPOSIT INSURANCE see FINAL INSURANCE (MINIMUM DEPOSIT INSURANCE).  
MINIMUM DEPOSIT RESCUE technique designed to permit the exchange of a life insurance policy that has an  
outstanding loan charged against it for another life insurance policy on a tax-free basis. The procedure is for the insurer  
to issue a new policy subject to a loan in the amount equal to the outstanding loan on the old policy. If the new policy so  
issued is of the form of a FLEXIBLE PREMIUM policy such as UNIVERSAL LIFE, the loan from the old policy can  
be replaced by the new policy assuming the loan.  
MINIMUM DEPOSIT WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE that generates a first year cash  
value from the payment of the first year premium. Using this cash value, loans could be made to finance premiums due  
in the future, with the interest deductible for tax purposes under specified IRS rules. However, the 1986 Tax Code  
revision appears to have canceled this arrangement.  
MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND TAXES FROM SECTION 401(a), 403(a), 403 RETIREMENT  
PLAN OR IRA requirement that income payments must begin from tax-deferred saving programs by April 1 of the  
calendar year after the calendar year in which the plan participant becomes age 70 1/2 or retires.

because the fixed expenses of placing a policy on the books exist regardless of the size of a group.  
MINIMUM PREMIUM DEPOSIT PLAN see MINIMUM DEPOSIT WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
MINIMUM PREMIUM PLAN smallest acceptable premium for which an insurance company will write a policy. This  
minimum charge is necessary to cover fixed expenses in placing the policy on the books.  
MINIMUM STANDARDS lowest acceptable criteria that a risk must meet in order to be insurable. For example, life  
insurance companies require an applicant for individual (nongroup) coverages to be free of terminal illness.  
MINI TAIL automatically extended reporting period of 60 days, during which claims may be made after a CLAIMS  
MADE BASIS LIABILITY COVERAGE policy has expired. See also INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED LOSSES  
(IBNR); LONG-TAIL LIABILITY.  
MINOR'S TRUST (2503(c)) TRUST whereby asset management is provided until a child reaches the age of majority.  
Upon reaching majority, the child has full use and control over the assets. The GRANTOR of the trust cannot receive  
any income from the assets held in the trust. All undistributed income is taxed at trust rates, which are low. The grantor,  
through this type of trust, is able to control the time at which the minor has access to the assets given to him or her by  
the grantor (who wishes to take advantage of the annual GIFT TAX exclusion). See also ESTATE PLANNING  
DISTRIBUTION; GIFT IN TRUST.  
MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES hospital charges in addition to room and board. Miscellaneous expenses are covered  
under a basic hospital plan, with the limits of coverage expressed either as a multiple of the daily hospital benefit for  
room and board or as a flat dollar amount. Expenses included in the coverage are X-rays, drugs, bandages, operating  
room expenses, and ambulance services. See also GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE; HEALTH INSURANCE;  
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO).  
MISCELLANEOUS VEHICLES COVERAGE endorsement to the PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) that  
insures other motorized vehicles such as golf carts and motorcycles owned by a policyholder.  
MISREPRESENTATION (FALSE PRETENSE) intent to defraud. An insured is required to answer truthfully all  
questions on the application. The insurance company can void a contract if it would not have issued a policy had it  
known the true facts. For example, on a PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY application, if the insured answers that  
the car is used only for pleasure (when in fact it is used in stock car races), the insurance company can void the policy.  
MISSTATEMENT OF AGE falsification of birth date by an applicant for a life or health insurance policy. If the  
company discovers that the

wrong age was given, the coverage will be adjusted to reflect the correct age according to the premiums paid in.  
MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX CLAUSE see MISSTATEMENT OF AGE.  
MIXED AGENCY AGENCY that sells INSURANCE POLICIES from both a STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY and  
a MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY.  
MIXED INSURANCE COMPANY one that combines the two forms of ownership, stock and mutual. A STOCK  
INSURANCE COMPANY is owned by stockholders, whereas a MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY is owned by its  
policyholders. A mixed company is owned in part by stockholders and in part by policyholders. Most mixed companies  
issue participating and nonparticipating policies.  
MIXED PERILS several different types of perils covered under one policy. See also HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE  
POLICY; PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP); COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY (CPP).  
MOBILE EQUIPMENT INSURANCE see CONTRACTORS EQUIPMENT FLOATER.  
MOBILE HOME INSURANCE coverage similar to a HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY in that Section I  
covers property exposure and Section II covers liability exposure.

coverage; Coverage Cadditions to the structure of the mobile home to include equipment; Coverage Dadditional living  
expense.  
2. Section II (liability) Coverage Eliability coverage for personal acts and/or omissions; Coverage Fmedical payments to  
others.

MODEL INSURERS SUPERVISION, REHABILITATION, AND LIQUIDATION ACT OF 1977 model law endorsed  
by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) giving state regulators broad new  
powers to deal with financially troubled insurance companies. The act was intended to replace the model Insurers  
Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act, which the NAIC endorsed in 1969. The new model would make it easier for  
insurance commissioners to gain control of impaired insurers by listing new grounds for placing them in  
LIQUIDATION AND REHABILITATION. The act also sets liquidation standards for interstate cooperation among  
regulators.  
MODEL SURPLUS LINES LAW law that requires that all SURPLUS LINES insurance companies maintain a  
minimum specified amount of CAPITAL and SURPLUS; also requires that ALIEN INSURERS maintain a trust fund  
on location in the United States.

MODEM device that connects a computer to a telephone line. This device permits the computer to communicate with  
other computers through the telephone system.  
MODE OF ENTRY  
1. method of gaining illegal entry to perform a criminal act. If a policyholder makes a claim for loss of jewelry or rugs  
under a homeowners policy, or if a business owner makes a claim for damage caused by vandals, the insurer must  
establish how the vandal or burglar gained entry. The mode of entry is important both (a) to determine that someone did  
actually enter the premises and (b) to establish that the policyholder was not unduly negligent.  
2. path by which a toxic substance enters the human body, such as by inhalation, injection, ingestion, or absorption.  
MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT adaptation of a standard insurance contract for special needs. Standard forms do  
not cover all needs but they can be adapted by an underwriter, broker, or an insurance company at the request of an  
insured. Risk managers may request many modifications in property and casualty coverage to meet the needs they have  
diagnosed for their corporations. Some risk managers even write their own contracts. Many insurers write their own  
contracts as well rather than use forms designed by a RATING BUREAU.  
MODIFICATION RATING (also known as MERIT RATING) method of setting property insurance rates by modifying  
or adjusting the MANUAL RATE for various classifications of risks. Modifications may be based on past or anticipated  
loss experience. The three types of modification rating are EXPERIENCE RATING, RETROSPECTIVE RATING, and  
SCHEDULE RATING.  
MODIFIED CASH REFUND ANNUITY form of CASH REFUND ANNUITY used by contributory pension or  
employee benefit plans. When employee participants die before receiving all of their contributions in the form of  
retirement benefits, this type of annuity guarantees to repay the remainder of those contributions, with interest, to the  
beneficiaries.  
MODIFIED LIFE INSURANCE ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE under which premiums are calculated so that the  
first few years of premiums are less than normal, and subsequent premiums are higher than normal. See also GRADED  
PREMIUM, WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
MODIFIED PRIOR APPROVAL see RATING BUREAU.  
MODIFIED PRIOR APPROVAL RATING form of state rating law that requires prior approval of property and  
casualty insurance premiums by the state insurance department for certain changes. Here, a state generally allows new  
rates to go into effect immediately after filing with the insurance department. However, changes in classification  
< previous page page_315 next page >  
 
< previous page page_316 next page >  
Page 316  
of risks or other substantial changes require prior insurance department approval. There are four methods of rate  
approval. In addition to modified prior approval, they are PRIOR APPROVAL RATING, open competition, and file  
and use.  
MODIFIED RESERVE METHODS accounting procedures that defer the full funding of a life insurance NET LEVEL  
PREMIUM RESERVE to accommodate the policy ACQUISITION COST in the early years of a policy. First-year  
policy expenses, such as agent commission, MEDICAL EXAMINATION, and PREMIUM TAX, often result in little of  
the PREMIUM remaining for the premium reserve required under FULL VALUATION RESERVE standards. In such  
cases, the difference comes out of the insurer's SURPLUS ACCOUNT. To avoid this, two types of modified reserve  
methods are used: (1) the FULL PRELIMINARY TERM RESERVE VALUATION method, and (2) the modified  
preliminary term reserve valuation method, better known as the commissioners' reserve valuation method. The full  
preliminary term method does not require any TERMINAL RESERVE at the end of the first year and in effect accounts  
for reserves like term insurance during this period. This leaves more of the premium available to cover acquisition cost  
and first-year claims. In subsequent years, for reserve accounting purposes, the policy is considered to have been issued  
one year later than its actual date on an insured who was one year older than his actual age. This results in stepping up  
additions to the premium reserve, eventually making up for the first year's shortfall.  
The commissioners' reserve valuation method limits first-year expenses and thus the amount of deferred funding of  
policy reserves. Policies whose premiums fall below a certain level can be accounted for under the full preliminary term  
method. For policies with premiums above that level, the full preliminary term method is modified by a limitation on  
the amount of expenses that can be used in figuring the schedule of deferred reserve funding.  
MODIFIED RESERVE STANDARDS see MODIFIED RESERVE METHODS.  
MODUS OPERANDI method of operation.  
MONETARY POLICY federal regulation of the money supply through changing commercial bank reserve  
requirements and interest rates, thereby stimulating the economy or deflating the economy.  
MONEY AND SECURITIES BROAD FORM POLICY coverage providing protection for a business against loss from  
a hazard under the On-Premises Form, that provides ALL RISK protection against the loss of money and securities; or  
the Off-Premises Form, ALL RISK protection against loss of money and securities while they are in possession of a  
messenger. There is no coinsurance deductible requirement.  
MONEY DAMAGES payments awarded by a court in a liability suit. Money damages can be broken down into  
compensatory and punitive. Compensatory damages reimburse a plaintiff for expenses incurred for  
< previous page page_316 next page >  
 
< previous page page_317 next page >  
Page 317  
such things as disability, disfigurement, and pain and suffering. Punitive damages go beyond this to punish and make an  
example of a defendant. In recent years, punitive damages have become increasingly common, and insurers claim that  
the frequency of multimillion dollar jury awards has made the business of underwriting difficult.  
MONEY MARKET INVESTMENTS short-term investments, to include the following: commercial paper, interestbearing  
balances with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, trading account  
securities, and loans held for resale.  
MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND fund that concentrates primarily on short-term government securities,  
certificates of deposit with maturities less than one year, and high-quality interest-bearing corporate debt. The fund is a  
pool of money from many investors from which interest is paid to these investors on the income earned by that pool of  
money. Income and yield fluctuate on a daily basis, but each share in the mutual fund maintains a constant value of $1,  
resulting in no capital gains or losses. These funds are ideal for short-term needs.  
Since these funds invest in financial instruments whose maturities are very short, reinvesting is on a continuous basis.  
Thus, as interest rates rise or fall, the funds' yields will correspond accordingly.  
MONEY PURCHASE PLAN contributions to a pension plan on a fixed basis according to a formula, with variable  
benefits. Contributions can be made under an ALLOCATED FUNDING INSTRUMENT (paid to an insurance  
company that purchases an individual ANNUITY or a group DEFERRED ANNUITY), or under an UNALLOCATED  
FUNDING INSTRUMENT. Individual benefits will be determined by the person's age, sex, normal retirement age, and  
rate schedules in effect at the time the insurance company receives the contributions. These plans are appropriate for an  
organization that must know its premium outlay in the years ahead. See also DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN.  
MONOLINE POLICY insurance protection written in the form of a single line policy.  
MONOPOLISTIC STATE FUND state operated insurance company used in WORKERS COMPENSATION  
INSURANCE in some states where the risks are so great that the commercial insurance companies cannot operate at  
affordable rates.  
MONTHLY DEBIT ORDINARY INSURANCE (MDO) coverage in which premiums are collected monthly on an  
ordinary life insurance policy. See also DEBIT INSURANCE (HOME SERVICE INSURANCE, INDUSTRIAL  
INSURANCE).  
MONTHLY INDEMNITY monthly income payment provided by a DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE policy to  
the insured wage earner when income has been interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or accident.

than charged for in the premium.  
MORTALITY SAVINGS difference between the actual mortality experience and the expected mortality experience. In  
statistical terms, this is known as the deviation of the actual (X) from the expected (X). The MORTALITY TABLE is  
conservative by nature in that the table assumes

the motor truck carrier if it is legally liable for the damage, destruction, or other loss of the customer's property being  
shipped. This includes lost packages, broken contents, and stolen articles. Two types of policies are available: (1) those  
that list the specific trucks to be covered in which the  
< previous page page_319 next page >  
 
< previous page page_320 next page >  
Page 320  
property may be damaged or destroyed; and (2) those that cover all of the insured's trucks, with no trucks listed  
specifically. This coverage is on the Gross Receipts Form, which in essence covers all operations of a motor carrier.  
MOTOR TRUCK CARGO RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION INSURANCE coverage for a common carrier (the

MOVING AVERAGE RATING METHOD procedure, in insurance, used in time series analysis to smooth out  
irregularities in projections of loss expectations. Irregularities to be smoothed out include: (1) loss experience that is not  
homogeneous, (2) loss experience from early policy years not representative of current loss experience, (3) adverse  
selection by policyholders, (4) changes in loss experience due to changing social values, and (5) loss experience  
distortion due to misleading averages.

New York State, where many insurers want to be licensed, allowed insurers to write only one line of insurance early in  
this century. But in 1949 New York passed a multiple line law, and most other states followed.  
MULTIPLE LOCATION FORMS type of coverage of property owned by one person at several locations, including  
merchandise, materials, fixtures, furniture, specified machinery, betterments, and improvements made by tenants.  
MULTIPLE LOCATION POLICY see MULTIPLE LOCATION FORMS.  
MULTIPLE LOCATION RISKS see MULTIPLE LOCATION FORMS.  
MULTIPLE PERIL INSURANCE personal and business property insurance that combines in one policy several types  
of property insurance covering numerous perils. However, no liability insurance is provided.  
MULTIPLE PROTECTION LIFE INSURANCE POLICY single LIFE INSURANCE policy combining TERM LIFE  
INSURANCE and ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE. If the INSURED dies during the term period, a multiple of the  
FACE AMOUNT is paid to the BENEFICIARY. If the insured dies after the term period has expired, only the face  
amount is paid to the beneficiary. For example, if the insured dies during the first 10 years that the policy is in force,  
three times the face amount is paid to the beneficiary; after the 10 years expires, the single face amount is paid to the  
beneficiary. Thus, during the multiple protection period both term insurance and ordinary life insurance are in force;  
after the multiple protection period expires, only ordinary life insurance is in force.  
MULTIPLE RETIREMENT AGES arrangement by which an employee can retire and receive full benefits without  
reduction, or reduced benefits subject to a penalty. These ages can be classified in the following manner:  
1. normal retirementearliest an employee can retire and receive full benefits, having reached a minimum age with a  
minimum number of years of service.  
< previous page page_321 next page >

Page 322  
2. early retirementearliest an employee can retire, having reached a minimum age and a minimum number of years of  
service, but with a penalty in the form of a reduction in benefits. The reduction is usually a percentage of benefit  
subtracted for each month of retirement earlier than the normal retirement age.  
3. deferred retirementwork beyond the normal retirement age. This may or may not result in an increase of benefits.  
MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE coverage that guarantees bondholders against default by a municipality. This form  
of financial guarantee was introduced in the early 1970s and became a runaway success. Municipalities embraced it  
because their offerings took on the credit rating of the company that wrote the insurance, rather than their own ratings. It  
meant that most municipal bond offerings were elevated to Triple-A, and municipalities could raise money at a lower  
rate of interest. For investors, it made municipal bonds less risky.  
MUNICIPAL INSURANCE property and/or liability coverage for a municipality. Municipalities are responsible for  
maintenance of throughways as well as a myriad of public services. Liability insurance for municipalities became an  
issue in the insurance crunch of 1985-1986, when this coverage became difficult to find, or became overly expensive.  
The problem was aggravated by court decisions in negligence cases in which the doctrine of joint and several liability  
came into play. This doctrine provides that a judgment against several defendants could be collected from one if the  
others were unable to pay. A municipality found to have been 10% liable in a traffic accident because of the improper  
placement of a stop sign might end up paying 100% of the judgment if the driver who was 90% responsible had no  
assets. This resulted in sharply higher premiums for municipal insurance.  
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS INSURANCE coverage for musicians and other providers of musical services such as  
musical instrument dealers. Musical instruments, service equipment, and sheet music are insured on an ALL RISKS  
basis at any location, subject to exclusions of wear and tear, war, and nuclear disaster. Each item must be specifically  
listed in the policy.  
MUTUAL ASSENT offer and acceptance upon which an agreement is based. For a contract to be legal (and thus  
enforceable in a court of law), an offer must be made by one party to another party, who accepts the offer. If properly  
negotiated, the insurance contract is deemed to be a contract of mutual assent.  
MUTUAL ATOMIC ENERGY REINSURANCE POOL group of mutual insurers that provides insurance for nuclear  
reactors that standard property and liability policies exclude. The federal government provides supplementary coverage.

MUTUAL FUND combination of contributions of many investors whose money is used to buy stocks, bonds,  
commodities, options, and/or money market funds, or precious metals such as gold, or foreign securities. In theory,  
mutual funds offer investors professional money management and diversification into conservative investments,  
aggressive investments, or combinations of these. Mutual funds are sold either with a sales charge (load), no sales  
charge (no-load), or a moderate sales charge (low load). These funds charge a management fee as a percentage of assets  
under management, usually 1% per year on a downward sliding scale as the asset base increases. Many insurance  
companies sell mutual funds.  
MUTUAL FUND INSURANCE financial guarantee policy that insures against loss of principal invested in a mutual  
fund.  
MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY company owned by its policy-owners; no stock is available for purchase on the  
stock exchanges. See also DIVIDEND OPTION, PARTICIPATING INSURANCE; STOCK INSURANCE  
COMPANY.  
MUTUALIZATION transformation of a STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY into a MUTUAL INSURANCE  
COMPANY, in which the stock company buys up and retires its shares.  
MUTUALIZATION OF RISK process of distributing the costs associated with losses and risks over a number of  
insureds.  
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE describing an instance where the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of a  
second event; for example, if a long-distance runner dies during a track meet, the runner cannot enter future track meets.  
MUTUAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE FUND fund that insures mortgages on homes for one to four families; also  
insures property improvement loans and loans to repair homes after a disaster. It is one of three funds operated by the  
Federal Housing Administration, which oversees mortgage guarantee insurance.  
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE EXCLUSION policy clause that excludes coverage for loss of property if the  
cause of the loss cannot be identified. Mysterious disappearance is an exclusion in a standard INLAND MARINE  
insurance all-risks policy. Because some theft insurance policies do not contain this exclusion, they implicitly insure  
against mysterious disappearance and would cover the loss of a diamond necklace, for example, even if the owner did  
not recall how it had been lost.

NAIC: INFORMATION AND PRIVACY PROTECTION MODEL ACT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS model state law designed to govern use of information collected from insurance  
applications. The law forbids any insurer or agent from impersonating someone else to gain information about an  
applicant, unless there is reasonable cause to suspect criminal activity. The law also provides that an insurer must give  
timely notice of renewal and other company policies. It also governs the method in which an insurer can gain  
information about a policyholder and the use that can be made of it. All applicants are allowed access to information  
that the insurer has collected about them, the right to correct it if wrong, and to learn the reason they were turned down  
for insurance.  
NAIC: INVESTMENT IN MEDIUM GRADE AND LOWER GRADE OBLIGATIONS NATIONAL ASSOCIATION  
OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS MODEL LAW model state law of the NAIC that stipulates that the total sum of  
medium grade bonds (bonds carrying a rating of 3, assigned by the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC) and lower  
grade bonds (bonds carrying a rating of 4, 5, or 6, assigned by the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC) cannot be  
greater than 20% of the insurance company's ADMITTED ASSETS. The total sum of bonds rated 4, 5, or 6 cannot  
exceed 10% of the company's admitted assets. In addition, no more than 3% of the admitted assets can be in bonds  
carrying a rating of 5 or 6; and no more than 1% of the admitted assets can be in bonds carrying a rating of 6. Bonds are  
rated by the Securities Valuation office from 1 (highest rating representing debt obligations of companies in excellent  
financial condition) to 6 (lowest rating representing debt obligations of companies in very poor financial condition).

SURRENDER COST INDEX.  
NAIC: LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE MODEL ACT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC setting minimum standards with which insurance products must  
comply if they are to qualify under the definition of a LONG-TERM CARE (LTC) insurance policy. These minimum  
standards include the following:  
1. Policies must be a GUARANTEED RENEWABLE CONTRACT.  
2. Specific illnesses (health problems) cannot be excluded from coverage.  
3. Summary of the policy in outline form must be provided the insured.  
4. FREE EXAMINATION ''FREE LOOK" PERIOD must be included in the policy during which time the  
POLICYHOLDER may cancel the policy for any reason and receive the return of the premiums paid in.  
5. Essentially the same benefits for custodial care and skilled nursing care must be provided by the policy.  
NAIC: MODEL ACT FOR LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY LANGUAGE SIMPLIFICATION  
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC that requires that  
the insurance policy contain language that meets a readability test (usually, the Flesch readability test that uses a  
formula approach to measure ease of reading), print used is subject to a minimum size, and a table of contents or index  
is to be included.  
NAIC: MODEL ANNUITY AND DEPOSIT FUND DISCLOSURE REGULATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC that requires that APPLICANT be furnished a Buyer's  
Guide to Annuities and a contract summary. The Buyer's Guide must contain information concerning: (1) the various  
kinds of annuity contracts available to fit the prospective ANNUITANT'S requirements; (2) the characteristics of  
annuities in general; and (3) benefits of the annuity contract.  
The contract summary must contain: (1) the CASH VALUES at the end of each year for the initial ten-year contract  
period; (2) DIVIDENDS (if a participating contract) each year for the initial ten-year contract period; (3) DEATH  
BENEFIT each year for the initial ten-year contract period; (4) yield on the GROSS PREMIUMS paid at the end of the  
initial ten-year contract period; and (5) date income payments are scheduled to commence to the annuitant.  
NAIC: MODEL ASSET VALUATION ACT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS  
model state law providing guidelines by regulators for valuation of securities on the books of insurance companies. The  
act has two sections: one for valuation of fixed rate bonds and debt securities, and the other covering valuation  
< previous page page_325 next page >  
 
< previous page page_326 next page >  
Page 326  
of other securities such as common and preferred stocks as well as stock in an insurance company's subsidiaries. The  
model law provides that bonds be valued at cost, adjusted for any purchase discounts or premiums. Preferred and  
guaranteed stocks while paying dividends can be carried at par value, while other securities such as common stocks are  
carried at market or appraised value. Valuation of stock in subsidiaries is limited by the law to no more than the value of  
the subsidiary's ADMITTED ASSETS when valued as if they were on the books of the insurance company parent.  
NAIC: MODEL BILL TO PROVIDE FOR THE REGULATION OF CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE NATIONAL  
ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC that stipulates that the purchaser  
(debtor) of a CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE (CREDITOR LIFE INSURANCE) policy must be provided a descriptive  
policy; the policy must terminate if the indebtedness is discharged or if the indebtedness is transferred to another  
creditor; there must be complete disclosure of the premium charges to the debtor, and any unearned premiums must be  
refunded to the debtor.  
NAIC: MODEL GROUP LIFE INSURANCE DEFINITION AND GROUP LIFE INSURANCE STANDARD  
PROVISIONS MODEL ACT model state law of the NAIC setting general standards for group life insurance contracts.  
It specifies which types of organizations can sponsor group life insurance plans and outlines the authority of the state  
regulator, including the power to require reasonable premiums. It contains consumer protection provisions such as a 31-  
day GRACE PERIOD for late payment of premiums, a clause making the policy not contestable after two years except  
for nonpayment of premium, and a CONVERSION PRIVILEGE, allowing an insured to convert a group insurance  
policy to an individual policy, regardless of state of health.  
NAIC: MODEL LIFE INSURANCE DISCLOSURE REGULATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC that requires that the insurance company and agent provide a  
prospective insured with written information concerning the cost and benefits of the life insurance policy under  
consideration for purchase. The information to be provided must be in the form of a buyer's guide and a policy  
summary. The buyer's guide is written in language that is dictated by regulation and must contain information  
concerning: (1) the appropriate amount of life insurance to purchase; (2) a comparison of the costs associated with the  
purchase of similar life insurance policies; and (3) the various kinds of life insurance policies available to fit the  
prospective insured's requirements.  
The policy summary must contain: (1) premiums to be paid each year for the initial five-year policy period; (2) CASH  
VALUES at the end of each year for the initial five-year policy period; (3) DIVIDENDS (if a PARTICIPATING  
POLICY) each year for the initial five-year period; and (4)  
< previous page page_326 next page >

Page 327  
DEATH BENEFIT each year for the initial five-year period. In addition, the name and address of the insurance  
company must be listed, as well as the insurance policy's generic name.  
NAIC: MODEL LIFE INSURANCE SOLICITATION REGULATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS model state regulation that governs method of selling life insurance to prevent fraud  
or misrepresentation by agents or insurers. A life insurance disclosure model regulation to help buyers understand the  
basic policy features and evaluate costs of similar insurance plans was adopted on an interim basis in 1973 and revised  
in 1976 and 1983. Today, insurers must provide a buyer's guide and a policy summary to prospective buyers. Insurers  
must keep files of authorized documents; agents must identify themselves and the company they represent and cannot  
represent themselves as financial planners or investment advisers unless they in fact are. In addition, reference to a  
dividend or any nonguaranteed item must be identified as such.  
NAIC: MODEL POLICY LOAN INTEREST RATE BILL NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS bill that allows the insurance company to include a CLAUSE in its POLICY that permits the  
POLICYHOLDER to make a POLICY LOAN at a variable interest rate on new policies. Under this clause, the  
following must be instituted by the insurance company: (1) interest rate cannot be changed more than four times each  
year; (2) at least once each year, an evaluation must be made of the requirement for any change in the interest rate; (3)  
interest rate cannot be changed to that of a rate higher than Moody's Composite Yield on seasoned corporate bonds,  
which is in effect two months prior to the establishment of the new rate or to a rate higher than the interest rate being  
credited to the CASH VALUE plus 1%. The rate change calculation that is utilized is the decision of the insurance  
company. No change in the interest rate can be made unless the adjustment is for an increase of at least one-half of 1%.  
Should the interest rate charged on policy loans currently decrease to an amount at least equal to one-half of 1% of that  
rate currently being charged, then the variable loan rate must be lowered in turn. There remains no requirement for the  
insurance company to actually increase the interest rate or to use a variable interest rate; the sole use of fixed interest  
rates is still permissible.  
NAIC: MODEL RATING LAWS NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS state laws  
based on a model law of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) that allow  
insurers to (1) set rates independently; or (2) adopt those rates developed by a rating bureau that must first be approved  
by the appropriate state regulator. Because state regulators believe that rate wars can be disastrous to the financial health  
of insurers, insurance companies are allowed to band together to set standard rates through rate making bureaus. Model  
rating laws also allow independent insurers to  
< previous page page_327 next page >  
 
< previous page page_328 next page >  
Page 328  
set their own rates, but prohibit the return of part of a premium to the insured other than as a dividend. Legislation  
developed from this model bill is called a prior approval law because the appropriate insurance commissioner must  
approve the rates involved. Other major types of rating laws are FILE-AND-USE RATING LAWS and OPEN  
COMPETITION LAWS.  
NAIC: MODEL UNIFORM INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS POLICY PROVISIONS LAW model state  
law of the NAIC that stipulates minimum benefits that must be contained in the policy's 12 required provisions and 11  
optional provisions. The most significant stipulations of the required provisions include: (1) GRACE PERIOD; (2)  
REINSTATEMENT clause; and (3) INCONTESTABLE CLAUSE. The most significant stipulation of the optional  
provisions include the MISSTATEMENT OF AGE clause.  
NAIC: MODEL UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE REGULATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC that stipulates minimum NONFORFEITURE VALUES, minimum  
VALUATION OF ASSETS requirements, and specific minimum policy PROVISIONS in UNIVERSAL LIFE  
INSURANCE products.  
NAIC: 1984 MODEL REPLACEMENT REGULATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC that requires the insurance agent who is replacing the policy to: (1)  
give the POLICYHOLDER a replacement notice; (2) forward a signed copy of the replacement notice to the replacing  
insurance company; and (3) forward copies of all sales proposals made to the policyholder. Model also requires the  
agent who is making a CONSERVATION effort to provide the policyholder and insurance company a copy of all  
materials associated with that effort.  
NAIC: STANDARD NONFORFEITURE LAW NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS  
model state statute that governs terms for surrender of individual deferred annuities and CASH VALUE LIFE  
INSURANCE. This model, adopted by most states in the late 1970s and early 1980s, requires that annuity and wholelife  
contracts have certain minimum values that are not forfeited by policyholders even if a policy is canceled. A  
formula is given for computing the present value, cash surrender value, and paid-up annuity benefits. The model  
requires insurers to state clearly if an annuity has limited or no death benefits.  
NAIC: STANDARD VALUATION LAW NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS law  
that stipulates the minimum RESERVE the life insurance company must maintain for its LIFE INSURANCE policies  
and ANNUITY contracts. This law was first developed by the NAIC as a method of calculation for reserves that would  
incorporate the first-year expenses incurred by the insurance company.

NAIC: VARIABLE ANNUITY MODEL REGULATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS model state law of the NAIC that stipulates that the contract owner must receive annual reports  
concerning the annuity unit values, the manner in which the variable benefits are calculated, and how separate account  
categories are maintained for the investments.  
NAIC: VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE MODEL REGULATION ACT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS model state law that stipulates minimum benefits that must be contained in the  
policy provisions, restrictions on policy illustrations, minimum reserve requirements, and minimum qualifications  
necessary for the insurance company to sell VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE (VLI). Some of the policy provisions, in  
addition to those found under the STANDARD PROVISIONS, LIFE INSURANCE, particular to VLI required by the  
NAIC regulation include: (1) if REINSTATEMENT of a VLI policy is to be effected, past-due premiums paid cannot  
be less than 110% of the increase in the policy's CASH VALUE immediately prior to the reinstatement; and (2) loans  
against the cash value may be made on either a fixed or a variable interest rate for an amount up to 90% of the cash  
value.  
NAII see NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT INSURERS (NAII).  
NAMED INSURED person, business, or organization specified as the insured(s) in a property or liability insurance  
policy. In some instances, the policy provides broader coverage to persons other than those named in the policy if they  
have the insured's permission to use the property that is insured. For example, someone who drives a car with the  
permission of the owner is protected by a PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP). In other cases, if the owner of  
a property is not named as an insured party, his or her interests may not be protected by the policy. For example, if two  
persons own a home and only one is named on the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, the interest of the other  
may not be covered. See also OTHER INSUREDS.  
NAMED NONOWNER COVERAGE insurance under the PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) through a  
named nonowner coverage endorsement offering protection for LIABILITY, uninsured motorists, and medical  
payments to a named insured who does not own an automobile.  
NAMED PERIL POLICY insurance contract under which covered perils are listed. Benefits for a covered loss are paid  
to the policyowner. If an unlisted peril strikes, no benefits are paid. For example, under the standard fire policy, fire is a  
particular listed peril. If an insured's home burns, he will be indemnified. See also ALL RISKS.  
NAME POSITION BOND FIDELITY BOND that covers a business if employees in listed positions commit dishonest  
acts, such as stealing money. See also BLANKET BOND; NAME SCHEDULE BOND.

NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM coverage against flooding for personal and business property under  
the National Flood Act of 1968, which encourages participation by private insurers in the program through an industry  
flood insurance pool. Property insurance companies with assets of $1 million or more may become members, either as  
risk bearers (who may issue their own policies) or as nonrisk bearers (who are limited to act as fiscal agents for the  
pool, and hence must use a syndicate-type policy as dictated by the pool). National Flood Insurance makes reasonable  
coverage available to those who could not buy it through private insurers before the 1968 act, and it encourages  
maximum participation extent by the private sector.  
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURERS ASSOCIATION pool of private insurers that provide initial flood insurance in  
cooperation with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In 1978, the association was  
superseded by the NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM administered by HUD.  
NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE government health care program in several European countries that has been  
proposed in various forms for the U.S., to be administered by the federal government.  
1. Plan Awould cover all U.S. residents. Comprehensive benefits, financed by a combination of payroll taxes and  
general revenues, would include physician services, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, home health services, and  
supporting services such as optometry, podiatry, devices and appliances, and dental care.

insurance. The entire U.S. population would be covered. Individuals with no federal income tax liability would receive  
full payment of health insurance premiums.  
NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH federal agency that researches injury and  
illness arising from workplace hazards and recommends standards for maximum exposures to hazardous substances.  
NATIONAL INSURANCE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION government group that provides reinsurance for

NATIONWIDE DEFINITION OF MARINE INSURANCE see NATIONWIDE MARINE DEFINITION.  
NATIONWIDE MARINE DEFINITION statement of the types of exposures classified under marine, inland marine or  
transportation insurance by placing them in the following categories: imports, exports, domestic shipments (goods in  
transit), communication vehicles (tunnels, bridges, piers, and power transmission lines), personal property floaters  
(stamp collections, coin collections, fine arts, paintings, musical instruments, silverware, and furs), commercial property

floaters (accounts receivable, valuable papers, valuable records, and physicians' and surgeons' instruments). The  
definition also makes use of the following differences in condition: electronic data, property in a bailee's custody, and  
property for sale by a dealer (such as musical instruments, cameras, fine arts, and jewelry).  
NATURAL DEATH death from other than accidental means. See also ACCIDENTAL DEATH CLAUSE; RIDERS,  
LIFE POLICIES.  
NATURAL LOSSES property damage, accident, or injury resulting from vagaries of nature, including tornadoes,  
hurricanes, and floods.  
NATURAL PREMIUM see PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD.  
NAVIGATION RISK INSURANCE coverage during the operation of a ship for: (1) Property of Ship (ship's hull,  
tackle, passenger fittings, equipment, stores, boats), and ordnance; (2) Property Damage Liability (ship's owner and/or  
operator is protected if the ship collides with another, causing damage and loss of use). Excluded is liability to the  
owner and/or operator for damage to piers, wharves, bodily injury, or loss to the insured ship's hull and/or cargo (this  
coverage amount is in addition to the amount of coverage on the insured ship's hull and cargo); and (3) Bodily Injury  
Liability Insurance.  
NCCI see NATIONAL COUNCIL ON COMPENSATION INSURANCE.  
NECESSITIES OF LIFE basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, and shelter, that a person requires to survive. These  
needs are the first layer of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and are the minimum that should be provided by any LIFE  
INSURANCE plan.  
NEEDS APPROACH personal insurance method used to analyze the amount necessary to maintain a family in its  
customary life-style, should the primary wage earner die. This includes such considerations as:  
1. immediate needs ("cleanup fund")expenses associated with final medical treatments and burial, inheritance taxes,  
estate taxes, probate costs, outstanding debt.  
2. continued incomewhile children are still in school and depend on family support.  
3. continued incomefor the surviving spouse after children no longer depend on family support.  
4. continued incometo pay a mortgage, education expenses, emergency expenses, and miscellaneous expenses.  
5. retirement fundfor the surviving spouse.  
From the sum of these expenses, subtract sources of income available to the surviving spouse (Social Security,  
investments, employee benefit plans such as group life insurance and pensions), to arrive at a final figure on which to  
base the amount of life insurance the wage earner should consider.  
NEGLECT failure to exercise proper care. Many property insurance policies exclude losses that result from negligence.  
Neglect is also the  
< previous page page_334 next page >  
 
< previous page page_335 next page >  
Page 335  
basis for many liability suits. If an injury can be demonstrated to result from negligence on the part of a homeowner, a  
product manufacturer, or a municipality responsible for maintaining streets, an injured party can often collect damages.  
NEGLIGENCE failure to act with the legally required degree of care for others, resulting in harm to them. See also  
TORT, UNINTENTIONAL.  
NEGLIGENCE, COMPARATIVE see COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE.  
NEGLIGENCE, CONTRlBUTORY see CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE.

NEGLIGENCE, PRESUMED see RES IPSA LOQUITOR.  
NEGLIGENT LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY see LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
NEGLIGENT MANUFACTURE charge against a business firm in a PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE lawsuit.  
Manufacturers have been held responsible for their products. When consumers become injured while operating a  
lawnmower, flying in an airplane, driving a car, or any of hundreds of other ways, they have grounds to sue the  
manufacturer of these products for negligence. Product liability has become one of the most rapidly growing areas of  
liability exposure for businesses and one of the most difficult to insure against.  
NEGOTIATED CONTRIBUTION PLAN defined contribution pension plan in which employer contributions are set  
under a collective bargaining agreement. It usually covers the employees of a number of firms and is administered by a  
board of trustees on which participating employers and unions are equally represented.  
NEON AND ELECTRIC SIGNS FLOATER coverage on an ALL RISKS basis through an endorsement to a business  
PROPERTY INSURANCE policy in which each sign is specifically scheduled, subject to the exclusions of wear and  
tear, and damage caused by nuclear hazard, war, and electricity.  
NEON AND FLUORESCENT SIGN INSURANCE coverage through an endorsement to the glass insurance policy on  
an ALL RISKS basis, subject to the exclusions of wear and tear, and damage caused by nuclear hazard, war, and  
electricity.  
NET AMOUNT AT RISK in life insurance, difference between the face value of a life insurance policy and its cash  
value (also known as ''pure amount of protection").  
NET ASSETS EQUATION income (premiums + investment earnings) minus disbursements (DIVIDENDS + death  
claims + policies surrendered for benefits + general expenses).

NET COST see LIFE INSURANCE COST.  
NET COST METHOD see LIFE INSURANCE COST.  
NET GAIN FROM OPERATIONS STATUTORY ACCOUNTING principles (SAP), as listed in the insurance  
company's annual financial statements filed with the insurance commissioner of each state in which it is licensed.  
Income that is equal to the net income is filed under GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  
(GAAP).  
NET INCOME AFTER TAXES total of OPERATING INCOME plus real-ized capital gains (losses) from investment  
and underwriting operations minus federal income taxes.  
NET INCOME MAKE-UP CHARITABLE REMAINDER UNITRUSTS (NIMCRUTs) type of CHARITABLE  
REMAINDER TRUST (CRT) that pays interest income for life or for a specified term to a nonchari-table beneficiary.  
The remainder of the interest is received by a charity. This trust pays a specified percentage of its fair market value with  
the beneficiary receiving only the interest and dividends earned by the trust for the current year. The trust does not pay  
out any unrealized income. If this payout of interest and dividends is less than the specified percentage as stated in the  
trust documents, the shortage is accumulated and paid to the beneficiary at some future date (the net income make-up  
provision goes into effect). For example, assume that the trust earns 6% in interest and 16% in UNREALIZED  
CAPITAL GAINS during the current year. The beneficiary receives only the 6% earned interest with the 16% in  
unrealized capital gains being accumulated for distribution to the beneficiary at a future date when the recognized  
income in the trust is sufficient to affect the payout. In those situations where the trust has no income from interest and  
dividends, the shortage owed to the beneficiary is accumulated for future distribution to that beneficiary.  
NET INCREASE amount of the increase in the BOOK OF BUSINESS of an INSURANCE COMPANY over a  
specified time interval. This increase is calculated as follows:  
NET INTEREST EARNED average interest earned by an insurer on its investments after investment expense, but  
before federal income tax.  
NET INVESTMENT INCOME total of interest, dividends, and other earnings derived from the insurance company's  
invested assets minus the expenses associated with these investments. Excluded from this income are capital gains or  
losses as the result of the sale of assets, as well as any unrealized capital gains or losses.  
NET LEVEL see NET LEVEL PREMIUM; NET LEVEL PREMIUM RESERVE.  
< previous page page_336 next page >  
 
< previous page page_337 next page >  
Page 337  
NET LEVEL PREMIUM life insurance payment that is constant from year to year. The premium may be paid  
throughout the life of an insured or may be limited to a maximum number, such as 30 annual premiums. The premium is  
based only on interest and a mortality assumption and does not consider an expense assumption. See also GROSS  
PREMIUM.  
NET LEVEL PREMIUM RESERVE fund that comes into existence because premiums for ordinary life insurance  
policies in their early years are higher than necessary for the pure cost of protection. These excess premiums, plus the  
interest credited, create the net level reserve. When an insured dies, the reserve comprises part of the death benefit. The  
net premium is calculated according to this fundamental actuarial equation: present value of future premiums = present  
value of future benefits.  
This relationship holds only at the point of issue of a life insurance policy. Thereafter, future benefits will exceed future  
premiums because fewer premiums are left to be paid and benefits are coming closer to being due. The reserve makes  
up the difference between the future benefits and future premiums at any point. This reserve can be calculated on either  
a prospective or retrospective basis, but it is important to note that the various state minimum reserve valuation laws are  
stated in terms of the prospective basis. See also FULL PRELIMINARY TERM RESERVE PLAN; PROSPECTIVE  
RESERVE; RETROSPECTIVE METHOD RESERVE COMPUTATION.  
NET LINE see NET RETAINED LINES.  
NET LINE LIMIT maximum amount of INSURANCE that an INSURANCE COMPANY will issue on a particular risk  
exposure. This limit is used by the insurance company to avoid having to pay for a loss on the exposure in excess of that  
which is acceptable to the company.  
NET LOSS amount of the loss absorbed by an INSURANCE COMPANY after deducting any REINSURANCE  
applicable to the loss, as well as SUBROGATION and ABANDONMENT AND SALVAGE rights.  
NET PAYMENT METHOD OF COMPARING COSTS see INTEREST ADJUSTED COST; LIFE INSURANCE  
COST.  
NET PAYMENTS INDEX table charting relative costs of a group of CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE policies  
derived by using the net cost method of comparing costs (traditional net cost method of comparing costs; net payment  
method). The net payments index contrasts with the interest adjusted SURRENDER COST INDEX and the INTEREST  
ADJUSTED COST index, which are derived by using the interest adjusted method of comparing policy costs.

NEW FUNDS injection of fresh capital from investors or from a parent corporation that is not an insurance company.  
NEW YORK INSURANCE CODE standard for insurance regulation in New York State and a model for insurance  
regulation elsewhere. For example, the standard fire policy was first adopted in New York State. Similarly, following  
the ARMSTRONG INVESTIGATION, the New York Insurance Code of 1906 became a model for cleaning up life  
insurance industry abuses. New York is widely viewed as the toughest state to get an insurance license, but because of  
the size of the insurance market there, many companies are willing to meet the stiff requirements.  
NEW YORK INSURANCE EXCHANGE reinsurance marketplace modeled after LLOYD'S OF LONDON. Like  
Lloyd's, the New York Insurance Exchange is a market for hard-to-place risks and for the placement of excess or  
surplus lines. See also SURPLUS LINES (EXCESS SURPLUS LINES).  
NEW YORK STANDARD FIRE POLICY contract first written in 1918 that provided the basis for modern-day  
property insurance, both personal and commercial. Forms and endorsements must be added to complete the policy and  
tailor it to cover the particular insured property. This policy is also known as the "165 Line" policy, for the number of  
lines in its text that covers CONCEALMENT or MISREPRESENTATION (FALSE PRETENSE), property and perils  
excluded; OTHER INSURANCE; cancellation due to increase in hazards; obligations to a mortgagee; pro rata  
contribution of a company; requirements of an insured in case of loss; conditions when a company must pay a loss  
incurred by an insured; and SUBROGATION. The New York Standard Fire Policy has become largely obsolete since  
1980, but its provisions have been incorporated into many other property insurance policies.

NEW YORK STATE COLLEGE CHOICE TUITION SAVINGS PROGRAM (NEW YORK'S COLLEGE SAVINGS  
PROGRAM) vehicle that is available to anyone in the United States as a means for savings in a tax-exempt fashion for  
college, graduate, or professional schools or other eligible accredited business, trade, occupational, or technical schools  
domiciled in the United States. Under the plan, there is a deferral of federal taxes on earnings of the account until the  
funds are distributed for education expenses by the beneficiary of the account. The account earnings are not subject to  
New York state taxes either. Upon withdrawal by the beneficiary, the earnings distribution is federally taxed at the  
beneficiary's tax rate and not subject to New York state tax provided the distribution is used for the above-approved  
education expenses. Any distributions not used for the approved education expenses are taxed at the regular federal and  
state income tax rate, and a 10% withdrawal penalty on the earnings must be paid.

NICHE WRITERS insurance companies that seek an economic advantage, thereby increasing their returns on equity by  
utilizing their specialized knowledge about a given line of insurance, territory, or risk classification.  
NO-FAULT AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE type of coverage in which an insured's own policy provides indemnity for  
bodily injury and/or property damage without regard to fault. In many instances it is difficult if not impossible to  
determine the original causesuch as who is at fault in a chain car collision. In states with no-fault liability insurance, an  
insured cannot sue for general damages until special damages including medical expenses exceed a minimum amount.  
This is an effort to eliminate groundless suits for general damages.  
NO FAULT LIABILITY INSURANCE see NO-FAULT AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE.  
NO-FAULT THRESHOLD amount for which financial loss for bodily injury incurred by the plaintiff must exceed  
before a TORT liability action may be brought.  
NO LAPSE GUARANTEE agreement by the insurance company to keep the UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE policy  
in force, even if the CASH VALUE becomes zero or less than zero, provided that a specified MINIMUM  
CONTINUATION PREMIUM is made at the required time.  
NO-LAPSE VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE policy of VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE  
(VUL) under which, if the accumulation of the premiums paid at any point in time (minus policy loans, and  
withdrawals) equals or exceeds the minimum premiums due at that point in time, the policy is prevented from lapsing.  
This

NONASSIGNABLE POLICY insurance policy, particularly PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE, which the  
owner cannot assign to a third party. See also ASSIGNMENT; ASSIGNMENT CLAUSE, LIFE INSURANCE.  
NONBOARD COMPANY INSURANCE COMPANY that does not utilize the rates and policies of a RATING  
BUREAU.  
NONCANCELLABLE DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE type of DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE that  
provides income payments to the wage earner when income is interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or  
accident and can continue to remain in force at the option of the INSURER until some stipulated age has been reached.  
NONCANCELLABLE GUARANTEED RENEWABLE POLICY health insurance that is not subject to alteration,  
termination, or increase in premium upon renewal.  
NONCANCELLABLE HEALTH INSURANCE see COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE.

COMPANY. Since the insurance  
< previous page page_340 next page >  
 
< previous page page_341 next page >  
Page 341  
policy is a UNILATERAL CONTRACT instead of a BILATERAL CONTRACT, the INSURED may cancel at will.  
Only the insurer makes a promise of future performance and only the insurer can be charged with breach of contract.  
NONCONCURRENCY circumstance under which several insurance policies cover an insured's property against  
damage or destruction, but since the limits of coverage, kinds of property, and perils covered are not the same under all  
policies, the insured may not be fully covered in the event of a loss.  
NONCONCURRENT APPORTIONMENT RULES standards used to determine claims payments in cases of  
overlapping property/liability insurance coverage. At one time, each type of insurance had its own rules to govern  
claims where more than one policy provided coverage. In 1963, several property/casualty industry groups agreed on a  
set of principles to be used in apportioning claims among insurers.  
NONCONFINING SICKNESS sickness incurred by the insured that does not require restriction of activity to the  
indoors. See also HEALTH INSURANCE.  
NONCONTRIBUTION MORTGAGE CLAUSE endorsement to standard fire policy to protect the interests of a  
mortgage lender without providing for APPORTIONMENT. A mortgage lender may choose to have his or her rights to  
the property protected by a MORTGAGE CLAUSE. Where an insured has more than one policy, claims are normally  
paid by assigning a portion of the loss among the insurance carriers under terms of the policy's PRO RATA LIABILITY  
CLAUSE. A full contribution mortgage clause provides that losses on the lender's interest would be apportioned in the  
same manner as the rest of the policy. But with a noncontribution mortgage clause, the lender's interest would be  
protected up to the policy limits with no apportionment.  
NONCONTRIBUTORY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN under which an employer pays the entire direct  
cost of the plan; employees do not share in the cost, except perhaps through comparatively lower wages.  
NONDEDUCTIBILITY OF EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS law that payments by an employer to a  
NONQUALIFIED PLAN are not deductible as a business expense for federal tax purposes.  
NONDISABLING INJURY injury that does not qualify either for partial or total disability income under a disability  
income or Workers Compensation policy.  
NONDISCRIMINATION RULES rules stating that, under the TAX EQUITY AND RESPONSIBILITY ACTS OF  
1982 AND 1983 (TEFRA), a plan cannot discriminate in favor of key employees regarding contributions and benefits if  
favorable tax treatment is to be retained. For example, the premiums the employer pays on behalf of the employee for  
the first  
< previous page page_341 next page >

Page 342  
$50,000 of group term life insurance are not considered taxable income to the employee if the plan does not  
discriminate.  
NONDUPLICATION COORDINATION-OF-BENEFITS (CARVEOUT COB) requirement that the combination of  
MEDICARE and the employer's plan can not be greater than the amount the employer's plan would pay without  
Medicare.  
NONDUPLICATION OF BENEFITS see COORDINATION OF BENEFITS.  
NONECONOMIC DAMAGES CAP statutory law that lowers the defendant's liability by restricting the monetary  
recovery of the plaintiff incurring a specified injury, such as pain and suffering, or by restricting the total amount of  
recoverable damages.  
NONFORFEITABILITY  
1. provision in a CASH VALUE INSURANCE policy that an insured will receive the equity in some form even if the  
insurance is canceled.  
2. vested benefit to a retirement plan participant. It is enforceable against the plan.  
See also NONFORFEITURE BENEFIT (OPTION); NONFORFEITURE CASH SURRENDER BENEFIT;  
NONFORFEITURE EXTENDED TERM BENEFIT; NON-FORFEITURE REDUCED PAID-UP BENEFIT.  
NONFORFEITURE BENEFIT (OPTION) provision that the equity of an insured in a life insurance policy cannot be  
forfeited. There are four benefits a policyholder can select under the option: CASH SURRENDER VALUE,  
EXTENDED TERM INSURANCE, LOAN VALUE, and PAID-UP INSURANCE. If none is elected, a clause in the  
policy will stipulate the option that automatically goes into effect, usually extended term insurance.  
NONFORFEITURE CASH SURRENDER BENEFIT amount in a cash value life insurance policy that a policyowner  
will receive upon surrender of the policy, minus any outstanding loan and accrued interest. A table in the policy shows  
the amount of cash surrender values. With some policies, the insurance company reserves the right to hold the cash  
surrender value for six months from time of notification, but this is rarely if ever applied today.  
NONFORFEITURE EXTENDED TERM BENEFIT right of a policyholder, in life insurance with cash values, to  
continue full coverage for a limited period, as shown in a table in the policy, with no further premiums payable.  
NONFORFEITURE FACTOR modified premium used to calculate CASH SURRENDER VALUES in excess of that  
required by the NAIC: STANDARD NONFORFEITURE LAW.  
NONFORFEITURE PROVISION value in life insurance policies that entitle the insured to these choices:  
< previous page page_342 next page >  
 
< previous page page_343 next page >  
Page 343  
(1) to relinquish the policy for its CASH SURRENDER VALUE. (Note that in the beginning years the cash value may  
be minimal because of expenses such as agent's commission, premium tax, and the cost of putting the policy on the  
insurance company's books.)  
(2) to take reduced paid-up insurance instead of the cash surrender value.  
(3) to take EXTENDED TERM INSURANCE for the full face amount instead of the cash surrender value.  
(4) to borrow from the company, using the cash value as collateral. Each policy provides a table illustrating the first 20  
years of its guaranteed cash values.  
NONFORFEITURE REDUCED PAID-UP BENEFIT right of a policyholder in life insurance with cash value to elect a  
smaller, fully paid-up policy, without any further premiums to pay. The amount of the paid-up policy is determined by  
the insured's age and the cash surrender value.  
NONFORFEITURE VALUES see NONFORFEITURE CASH SURRENDER BENEFIT; NONFORFEITURE

NONINVESTMENT GRADE BONDS bonds that are less than investment grade plus the bonds that are in or  
approaching default, which comprise part of the insurance company's investment bond portfolio.  
NONINSURANCE RISK see UNINSURABLE RISK.  
NONINSURANCE TRANSFER risk management technique for shifting a corporation's exposure from itself. A risk  
manager looks at many alternatives to insurance to limit the risks a business firm faces. One transfer method is by  
contract, such as HOLD-HARMLESS AGREEMENTS, or to insert in an existing contract an endorsement stating that  
the business firm will not be responsible for something that would normally fall within its responsibility.  
NONINSURED DRIVER operator with no liability insurance. If a noninsured driver hits another car, the victim  
sometimes has no recourse against the driver. For this reason, many motorists carry UNINSURED MOTORIST  
COVERAGE, an endorsement to the PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) that covers them if they are  
involved in a collision with a driver without liability insurance. Some states also maintain an UNSATISFIED  
JUDGMENT FUND to pay claims to innocent victims of automobile accidents.  
NONLEDGER ASSETS assets of an INSURER that are due and payable in the current year but have yet to be received  
by the insurer.

automobile, a house, a television set, a radio, etc.  
NONMEDICAL APPLICATION see NONMEDICAL LIFE INSURANCE.  
NONMEDICAL LIFE INSURANCE coverage in which an applicant not required to take a medical examination,  
instead answers written questions to ascertain his current physical condition.  
NONMEDICAL LIMIT dollar ceiling on a life insurance policy for applicants who are not given a medical  
examination. The insurer accepts a health questionnaire in the place of a physical examination. At one time, a medical  
examination was a requirement for anyone buying life insurance. In recent years, however, most companies write  
NONMEDICAL LIFE INSURANCE because the savings in expenses for the company have been found to offset the  
higher risk of underwriting insurance without the benefit of an examination. However, nonmedical policies are written  
only for a STANDARD RISK.  
NONOCCUPATIONAL DISABILITY condition that results from injury or disease that is not job related. Workers  
compensation applies to employees disabled by on-the-job injuries or disease. In addition, five states require employers  
to pay income (not medical expense) benefits if a worker is disabled by illness or injury that did not occur at work:  
Rhode Island, California, New Jersey, New York, and Hawaii. Except for Rhode Island, employers may buy private  
coverage; in Rhode Island, they must get coverage from a state fund. Hawaii is the only state without an optional state  
fund.  
NONOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY insurance coverage for accidents and sickness that are not  
job related.  
NONOCCUPATIONAL POLICY health and medical insurance that excludes coverage for job-related injuries and  
illnesses. Most medical insurance policies do not provide benefits for job-related claims, which are covered by  
WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS.  
NONOWNERSHIP AIRCRAFT LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage in a separate policy or as an endorsement to the  
COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY (CGL) form, for insureds responsible for aircraft they do not own. If an  
aircraft is leased from another firm or owned by employees who operate it for a business owner, the insured's liability  
exposure is not covered by the CGL policy; a special endorsement is necessary.  
NONOWNERSHIP AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage in a separate policy or as an endorsement to  
the COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY (CGL) form, for liability exposures for an employee who drives a leased  
car or his or her own automobile for business purposes.  
NONOWNERSHIP LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for an employer against liability for property damage or  
physical injury caused by an employee operating a personally owned vehicle for the  
< previous page page_344 next page >  
 
< previous page page_345 next page >  
Page 345  
business firm. Employers can be held liable if an employee has an accident while driving a leased automobile or  
operating a motorboat that the employee owns, if it is done for the benefit of the employer. See also NONOWNERSHIP  
AIRCRAFT LIABILITY INSURANCE; NONOWNER-SHIP AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
NONPARTICIPATING GUARANTEED INSURANCE CONTRACT (GIC) type of GUARANTEED INSURANCE  
CONTRACT in which the term is fixed, the rate is fixed, and the contract owner does not participate in the insurance  
company's earnings.  
NONPARTICIPATING INSURANCE policy not designed to pay the policyowner a dividend. See also CURRENT  
ASSUMPTION; PARTICIPATING INSURANCE.  
NONPARTICIPATING LIFE INSURANCE see NONPARTICIPATING INSURANCE.  
NONPARTICIPATING POLICY see NONPARTICIPATING INSURANCE.  
NONPROFIT INSURER company formed and operated without the profit motive as its normal business objective;  
normally sells and services health insurance policies. See also BLUE CROSS; BLUE SHIELD.  
NONPROPORTIONAL AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE obligatory reinsurance contract in which a reinsurer agrees to  
pay for all or a large portion of losses up to a limit, when these losses exceed the retention level of the cedent. The  
reinsurance premium paid by the cedent is calculated independently of the premium charged to the insured. It is not  
expected that every treaty will pay for itself or that every loss will be recouped by the reinsurer. When a cedent  
reinsures on a nonproportional basis, it retains substantially more of its profits than reinsuring on a proportional basis.  
Nonproportional differs from proportional reinsurance in that it does not involve the sharing of risks.  
NONPROPORTIONAL FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE coverage in which an insurer is not bound to CEDE and a  
reinsurer is not bound to accept a risk. A separate reinsurance contract covers each cession. The contract is  
automatically renewed if the original insurance is renewed. Casualty facultative reinsurance is usually written on excess  
of loss basis, and the reinsurer shares only in losses which exceed retention level of the cedent.  
NONPROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE arrangement in which a reinsurer makes payments to an insurer whose losses  
exceed a predetermined retention level. Nonproportional reinsurance is either facultative or automatic. See also  
CATASTROPHE LOSS; EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE; STOP LOSS REINSURANCE.  
NONQUALIFIED PLAN employee benefit plan that does not have the federal tax advantages of a qualified pension  
plan, in which employers receive a federal tax deduction for contributions paid into the plan on behalf of their  
employees. For an employer, not having a tax deduction  
< previous page page_345 next page >  
 
< previous page page_346 next page >  
Page 346  
can be a serious disadvantage, but a nonqualified plan has these advantages:  
1. otherwise discriminatory coverage for some employees is allowed.  
2. benefits can be allocated to certain employees whom the employer wishes to reward. The result could be that the total  
cost of the benefits for a particular group of employees may be less under a non-qualified plan than for all employees  
under a qualified plan.  
NONRENEWAL CLAUSE provision in a policy that states the circumstances under which an insurer may elect not to  
renew the policy.  
NONRESIDENT AGENT agent who is licensed and who markets and services insurance policies in a state in which he  
or she is not domiciled.  
NONSMOKER health characteristic considered by an insurer under-writing an applicant for life or health insurance.  
Many insurance companies charge reduced premiums for nonsmokers.  
NONSTOCK INSURANCE COMPANY INSURANCE COMPANY that has no outstanding shares of stock, such as a  
MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY.  
NONTRADITIONAL REINSURANCE types of REINSURANCE instruments under which the amount of RISK  
transferred is more limited than under TRADITIONAL RISK REINSURANCE instruments. The limitations on risk  
transfer take the form of an aggregate dollar amount or loss ratio limits according to the reinsurance coverage in effect.  
Premiums for nontraditional reinsurance instruments are usually larger than those for traditional reinsurance instruments.  
NONVALUED INSURANCE POLICY POLICY under which the INSURER will pay the actual cash value of the  
property at the time the property was damaged or destroyed provided the loss falls within the LIMITATIONS of the  
policy.  
NONWAIVER AGREEMENT agreement by the insured that, simply because the INSURER investigates and  
determines a value for the CLAIM, the insurer does not admit liability for the claim.  
NOON CLAUSE CLAUSE in the INSURANCE POLICY that stipulates the exact time the policy coverage begins and  
terminates.  
NORMAL ANNUITY FORM cost computation form that assumes retirement and commencement of annuity payments  
on the first day of the month nearest the birthday when a retiree reaches normal retirement age. Most employee pension  
plans provide for a normal retirement age of 65, with pension or annuity payments to begin at that time. But many also  
provide an optional annuity form for those who wish to either retire before or continue working past the normal  
retirement age. These employees receive reduced benefits, in the case of the early retirees, or, possibly, enhanced  
benefits for those who work longer.  
NORMAL LOSS particular type of loss which is expected by an organization and for which provision is usually made  
in the budgeting

process of the organization. See also SELF INSURANCE; SELF-INSURED RETENTION (SIR).  
NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE earliest age at which an employee can retire without a penalty reduction in pension  
benefits after having (1) reached a minimum age and (2) served a minimum number of years with an employer.  
Historically, this has been 65 years, but many private pension plans now envision earlier or later normal retirement ages.  
NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (NAFTA) OF 1993 agreement that eliminates tariffs among the  
United States, Canada, and Mexico over a 15-year period. Approximately 65% of United States agricultural and  
industrial exports would be eligible for duty-free entry into Mexico and Canada, either on an immediate basis or within  
five years. This could very well expand insurance operations both south and north of the border.  
NOTICE OF CANCELLATION CLAUSE provision in an insurance policy that permits an insured to cancel the policy  
and recoup the excess of the paid premiums above the customary short rate for the expired time. The clause also  
permits a company to cancel the policy at any time by sending the insured five days' written notice and repaying the  
excess of the paid premium above the pro rata premium for the expired time.  
NOTICE TO COMPANY written notice, to be submitted by the CLAIMANT, required by the insurance company in the  
event of an INSURED PERIL. This notice is part of the standard PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE  
PROVISIONS defining the insured's obligations after a loss.  
NSC see NATIONAL SAFETY COUNCIL.  
NUCLEAR ENERGY LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability resulting  
from the nuclear energy material (whether or not radioactive) on the insured business's premises or in transit. This  
insurance has become more significant since the Three Mile Island accident. In order to obtain a license for a nuclear  
facility, there must be evidence of financial responsibility such as insurance. Nuclear energy liability is excluded from  
nearly all other liability policies.  
NUCLEAR REACTION EXCLUSION clause in most property insurance policies that excepts coverage for loss from a  
nuclear reaction or radiation, or radioactive contamination. (However, a fire resulting from one of these perils would be  
covered.) Because of this exclusion, insurer pools have been formed to write coverage for nuclear reactors. In addition,  
the NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION is authorized to provide coverage under the PRICE-ANDERSON  
ACT.  
NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION U.S. government agency (formerly the Atomic Energy Commission)  
responsible for regulating the nuclear energy industry. The commission also provides  
< previous page page_347 next page >

Page 348  
supplemental insurance for nuclear facilities to augment coverage by private insurance pools.  
NUISANCE product or service that does more harm than good to society, or endangers life or health. Society would  
probably be better off without such a product or service. See also ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE.  
NUMERICAL RATING SYSTEM underwriting method used in classifying applicants for life insurance according to  
certain demographic factors and assigning weights to these factors. Factors include physical condition, build, family  
history, personal history, habits, and morals. For example, if an applicant is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 250 pounds, his  
mortality expectation based on this height-weight ratio may be 160% of a standard risk who weighs 150 pounds at that  
height. In this instance a debit of 60 percentage points would be listed next to the weight factor on the applicant's  
underwriting sheet. If the applicant has an excellent family history (no hereditary diseases such as diabetes), his  
mortality expectation based on this factor is 90% of the standard risk. Here a credit of 10 percentage points would be  
listed next to the family history factor. Upon completion of the debiting/crediting process, debits and credits would be  
totaled for a final rate, which would classify the applicant as standard, substandard, or an uninsurable risk.

OBLIGATORY REINSURANCE see AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE.  
OBLIGEE see FIDELITY BOND; LIABILITY, BUSINESS EXPOSURES; SURETY BOND.  
OBLIGOR individual or other entity who has promised to perform a certain act. For example, an insurance company  
promises to pay a death benefit if a life insurance policy is in force at the time of the death of an insured.  
OBSOLESCENCE decrease in value of property as the result of technological advancement and/or changing social  
mores. This factor is used to measure the amount of depreciation in determining the ACTUAL CASH VALUE of  
damaged or destroyed property protected by PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERAGE.  
OCCUPANCY AND FIRE RATES direct relationship between the use to which a building is put and the likelihood that  
it will catch on fire. Occupancy is one of the most important factors in setting fire insurance rates. For example, a  
building that houses an explosives manufacturer is at much greater risk than one occupied by a jewelry boutique. Other  
factors that influence the risk of fire are geographical location, construction, nature of the neighborhood, and the  
adequacy of protective devices.  
OCCUPATION see OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.  
OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT work-related accident. Occupational accidents that injure employees are the  
responsibility of the employer and are covered by WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. In recent years, the  
term occupational accident has been expanded to include job-related long-term exposure to hazardous substances that  
result in occupational diseases, and such emotional injuries as nervous breakdowns and even heart attacks.  
OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION classification of occupations according to the DEGREE OF RISK inherent in  
that occupation. See also OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD; OCCUPATION, RISK.  
OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE illness contracted as the result of employment-related exposures and conditions.  
Coverage for such diseases is found under WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE.  
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD condition surrounding a work environment that increases the probability of death,  
disability, or illness to a worker. This class of hazard is considered when writing WORKERS

COMPENSATION INSURANCE or determining which underwriting classification to place an applicant for life or  
health insurance.  
OCCUPATIONAL INJURY see OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT; OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD; OCCUPATION  
RISK.  
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT (OSHA) 1970 legislation that set federal standards for workplace  
safety and imposed fines for failure to meet them. A controversial law, it took much of the power from the states for  
regulating workplace safety. It authorized the U.S. Department of Labor to have federal compliance officers make  
surprise inspections of business firms. It set up the NATIONAL COMMISSION OF STATE WORKERS  
COMPENSATION LAWS to recommend upgrade of worker protection, including higher disability benefits,  
compulsory coverage, and unlimited medical care and rehabilitation. Most states adopted the recommendations, which  
incidentally led to increases in workers compensation insurance premiums.  
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION STANDARD ON BLOOD-BORNE  
PATHOGENS standard designed to reduce occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens (microorganisms in human  
blood that can cause diseases in humans, such as HIV and hepatitis B). The standard emphasizes using a combination of  
personal protective clothing and equipment, vaccination, engineering controls, work practice controls, and training.  
OCCUPATION, RISK relationship between occupation of an insured and degree of risk in such coverages as life,  
health, and workers compensation. Some occupations are more risky than others; for example, a high wire performer  
would have to pay more for life insurance than a banker. But the impact of occupation goes further. Claims resulting  
from exposure to toxic substances that result in occupational disease have been one of the most costly business  
insurance expenses of recent years. Life and health insurance underwriters also consider whether the occupation of a  
potential insured is likely to encourage a reckless lifestyle. For example, certain high-pressure occupations, like acting  
or Wall Street trading, might be considered to lead to overconsumption of alcohol or drug abuse. Occupation is one of  
many factors weighed by the underwriter in RISK SELECTION.  
OCCURRENCE event that results in bodily injury and/or property damage to a THIRD PARTY. A CLAUSE that is  
common to most LIABILITY INSURANCE policies stipulates that all bodily injuries and/or property damages  
resulting from the same general conditions are interpreted as resulting from one occurrence and thus subject to the  
policy limits per occurrence.  
OCCURRENCE BASIS coverage, in liability insurance, for harm suffered by others because of events occurring while  
a policy is in force, regardless of when a claim is actually made. See also CLAIMS MADE BASIS LIABILITY  
COVERAGE.

OCCURRENCE/INJURY THEORY viewpoint that an insurer whose liability policy is in force at the time of an  
accident or injury should pay a claim. See also LONG-TAIL LIABILITY; MANIFESTATION/INJURY THEORY.  
OCCURRENCE LIMIT maximum amount that an insurance company is obligated to pay all injured parties seeking  
recourse as the result of the occurrence of an event covered under a LIABILITY INSURANCE policy. In order for the  
coverage to apply, the policy must have been written on an OCCURRENCE BASIS.  
OCEAN ACCIDENT AND GUARANTEE CORPORATION major credit insurer of the early 20th century that merged  
into the London Guarantee and Accident Co. in 1931.  
OCEAN MARINE EXPOSURE possibility of loss associated with water transportation, including hull damage or  
destruction, cargo damage or destruction, liability to others for bodily injury, and property damage or destruction.  
OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE coverage in the event of a marine loss. Marine loss is damage or destruction of a  
ship's hull and the ship's cargo (freight) as the result of the occurrence of an insured peril. Perils insured against include  
collision of the ship with another ship or object; the ship sinking, capsizing, or being stranded; fire; piracy; jettisoning  
(throwing overboard of property to save other property); barratry (fraud or other illegal act by a ship's master or crew,  
resulting in damage or destruction of the ship and/or cargo), and various other liability exposures. To be covered, an act  
cannot involve prior knowledge by the owner of the ship or its cargo. Excluded are wear and tear, dampness, decay,  
mold, and war. See also OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE, WAR RISKS.  
OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE, WAR RISKS coverage on cargo in overseas ships for war-caused liability excluded  
under standard OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE. Not covered is cargo awaiting shipment on a wharf, or on ships after  
15 days of arrival at a port. Confiscation of the cargo by a government is covered. Most policies have an automatic  
termination clause that goes into effect within 60 days of the declaration of war between countries specified in the  
policy.  
OCEAN MARINE PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY INSURANCE coverage for bodily injury and property damage  
liability excluded under standard OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE. Coverage includes protection of wharfs, docks, and  
harbors; bodily injury; cost of removing the wreck if ship is sunk; and the cost of disinfecting and quarantining a ship.  
ODDS probable number of times that a specified event is likely to occur.  
For example, if E is the event, then the odds for E occurring are X to Y according to the following relationship:  
< previous page page_351 next page >  
 
< previous page page_352 next page >  
Page 352  
where P = probability. The odds against E occurring are Y to X. For example, if the probability of E occurring equals 0.6  
[P(E) = 0.6], then  
Therefore, the odds for E occurring are 6 to 4. The odds against E occurring are 4 to 6.  
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK risk associated with excessive rate of growth in premiums and contingencies such as  
affiliate company requirements.  
OFFER application for a policy, in life insurance, accompanied by the first premium; in property and casualty  
insurance, the insurance application itself.  
OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE submission of the APPLICATION and the first premium by the prospective  
INSUREDthe ''offer"and the issuance of the INSURANCE POLICY by the insurance companythe "acceptance."  
OFFEREE  
1. in life insurance, receipt by a company of an insurance application accompanied by the first premium.  
2. in property and casualty insurance, a company's receipt of an application.  
OFFICE BURGLARY AND ROBBERY INSURANCE coverage for the office of a business, or an individual in a  
general office building or other structure. Includes burglary of a safe; damage caused by robbery and burglary, actual or  
attempted; theft of office furniture, equipment, supplies and fixtures within an office; robbery inside and outside an  
office; kidnapping so as to force managers of an office and/or their representatives to open the office from the outside;  
and theft of securities and monies from the home of a messenger of the office and/or from a night depository of a bank.  
OFFICE CONTENTS FORM see OFFICE BURGLARY AND ROBBERY INSURANCE.  
OFFICE PERSONAL PROPERTY FORM endorsement to many commercial property insurance policies that covers  
office equipment. Coverage includes all equipment, whether or not owned by an insured, improvements an insured has  
made to his or her office (if leased), and valuable documents such as manuscripts. This also applies to property that has  
been purchased for the office while in transit.

OFFICERS PROTECTIVE MARINE INSURANCE type of insurance providing ALL RISKS coverage for personal  
property of the crew and passengers aboard a ship. Marine cargo insurance does not cover personal property of the crew  
and passengers, thus necessitating the purchase of an Officers Protective Policy.  
OFFICIAL BONDS see PUBLIC EMPLOYEES BLANKET BOND; PUBLIC OFFICIAL BONDS.  
OFF PREMISES location that is different from an insured's home or place of business. Under the standard  
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, the property of the insured is covered off premises; for example, if it is  
stolen from an airport. Likewise, an employer is liable for physical injury and property damage caused by an employee  
or by equipment, even if it does not occur at the place of business. If a truck spills chemicals on the highway or at  
another business site, or if a salesperson injures a client on a sales call, the employer is responsible. Business liability  
policies insure against such risks.  
OFFSET APPROACH method of integrating an employee's Social Security or other retirement benefits with a qualified  
retirement plan. Some employers offset (reduce) retirement or disability income benefits from an employee's Social  
Security income, reasoning that since Social Security taxes are a business expense for them, they should reduce or offset  
employee pension benefits by a percentage of the Social Security money. An employer with a 100% offset would  
subtract the entire Social Security payment from the earned pension and pay only the difference as the employee  
pension. A 50% offset means the employer subtracts half of the Social Security benefit from the pension benefit and  
pays the difference.  
OL&T see OWNERS, LANDLORDS, AND TENANTS LIABILITY POLICY.  
OLD AGE, SURVIVORS, DISABILITY, AND HEALTH INSURANCE (OASDHI) federal social insurance program  
that provides monthly benefits to qualified retirees, their dependents, their survivors, and, in some cases, disabled  
workers. OASDHI was created by the Social Security Act of 1935. Federal taxes are withheld from the paychecks of all  
covered workers, which includes most workers with the exception of public employees and certain union employees.  
Self-employed persons are also required to pay the tax. Benefits are paid to retired workers after age 65, with a partial  
benefit for retirees at age 62. Dependents and survivors of qualified workers also qualify for benefits, as do some  
categories of disabled workers and their dependents.  
OLD LINE COMPANY imprecise term still occasionally used by commercial or PROPRIETARY INSURERS to  
differentiate them from fraternal insurers. "Old line" was apparently meant to make these companies sound more  
established and distinguished.

opposed to FRATERNAL LIFE INSURANCE companies, many of which now operate on a legal reserve basis.  
OMISSIONS wrongful inaction; failure to act; inactivity.  
OMISSIONS CLAUSE provision of a treaty reinsurance contract stating that if an insurer fails to report a risk that

OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1987: IMPLICATIONS FOR ESTATE PLANNING legislation  
that provides for the inclusion in the estate of the decedent of lifetime transfers that involve a retained life interest in the  
following manner:  
1. decedent sells or gives to a family member a remainder interest in a business.  
2. decedent transfers more than 50% of appreciation interest into a general partnership but retains the limited  
partnership interest.  
3. decedent sells or gives to a family member more than 50% of common stock interest in a corporation but retains the  
preferred stock interest in the corporation.  
OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1993 act designed to help reduce the federal deficit by  
approximately $496 billion over five years through a restructuring of the tax code. The following include some of the  
major provisions that will have an impact on financial planning:  
1. Establishment of a new top tax rate on ordinary income (wages, interest, dividends, etc.) of 36% on taxable income  
alone:  
Filing Status Applicable  
Threshold  
Married individuals  
filing joint returns  
$140,000  
Heads of  
households  
127,500  
Unmarried  
individuals  
115,000  
Married individuals filing  
separate returns  
70,000  
Estates and  
trusts  
5,500  
2. Establishment of a new 10% surtax on individuals with taxable income in excess of $250,000; except for married

3. Establishment of a new 39.6% marginal tax rate, which includes the above 10% surtax, to be applied to taxable  
income in excess of the $250,000. Long-term capital gains are not subject to the higher rates, and will not be taxed at a  
rate higher than 28%. Since the passage of this Act, the maximum long-term capital gains tax has been reduced to 20%.  
 
4. Establishment of a new two-tiered progressive Alternative Minimum Tax rate schedule for noncorporate taxpayers as  
follows:  
< previous page page_354 next page >  
 
< previous page page_355 next page >  
Page 355  
(a) married individuals filing a joint return would pay a 26% rate on Alternative Minimum Taxable Income up to  
$175,000, and a 28% rate on Alternative Minimum Taxable Income in excess of $175,000;  
(b) married individuals filing separate returns would pay a 28% rate on Alternative Minimum Taxable Income in  
excess of $87,500.  
5. Exemptions under the Alternative Minimum Tax increased as follows:  
(a) to $45,000 from $40,000 for married individuals filing joint returns;  
(b) to $22,500 from $20,000 for married individuals filing separate returns, as well as estates and trusts;  
(c) to $33,750 from $30,000 for single individuals.

200,000 54,529 57,529 3,000  
7. Elimination of the dollar limitation cap on self-employment income and wages subject to medicare hospital insurance.  
8. Establishment of new maximum estate and gift tax rates as follows:  
(a) for transfers between $2.5 million and $3 million, a 53% rate is applied;  
(b) for transfers in excess of $3 million, a 55% rate is applied.  
9. Deductible of allowable meals and entertainment to the extent of 50% of costs.  
10. No deduction for club dues permitted; however, particular business expenses such as meals and entertainment  
incurred at a club are deductible to the extent of 50% of costs.  
11. For the publicly held corporation, no deduction permitted for compensation paid over $1 million for any one of its  
highest five executives.  
12. For qualified retirement plan contributions, a reduced compensation ceiling from $235,840 in 1993 to $150,000  
beginning in 1994. The $150,000 ceiling is to be indexed according to the inflation index each year beginning in 1996.  
13. For Social Security recipients, up to 85% of Social Security benefits taxable for married retirees with income in  
excess of $44,000 and for single retirees income in excess of $34,000.  
 
14. For self-employed individuals, a deduction as a business expense up to 25% of the premiums paid for health  
insurance coverage for that individual, spouse, and dependents.

15. Repeal of the luxury excise tax of 10% on boats, aircraft, jewelry, and furs. The luxury excise tax of 10% indexed  
for inflation remains for automobiles in excess of $30,000.  
16. Maximum corporate tax rate increased to 35% on taxable income above $10 million. For the personal service  
corporation, the flat rate is increased to 35%.

RATING, MODIFIED PRIOR APPROVAL RATING and file and use. At one time the insurance industry operated like  
a cartel, with rates set by bureaus and filed with the insurance commissioners of each state. Experts believed that  
competition would result in either unfairly high rates or unreasonably low rates that would lead to mass insurance  
company insolvencies. But open competition became widespread after New York State adopted it in 1969.

(2) Form ML.2 insures businesses with a distilled spirits risk exposure; and (3) Form A insures businesses with  
relatively small risk exposures, at either a single or multiple locations. See also BLANKET INSURANCE.  
OPEN POLICY coverage normally used on an indefinite basis under OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE and INLAND  
MARINE INSURANCE (TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE): BUSINESS RISKS for the damage or destruction of a  
shipper's goods in transit. While the policy is in force, the shipper is required each month to submit to the insurance  
company reports on goods being shipped to be covered by the policy; premiums are also submitted at that time.

destruction by an insured peril.  
ORDINARY PAYROLL EXCLUSION ENDORSEMENT provision in BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE  
that excludes coverage for continuing the wages of rank and file employees. Business interruption insurance covers  
anemployer for loss of earnings, including payroll expense, that occurs when a business must be shut down as a result of  
a direct insurable loss, such as a fire. However, in order to save on the premium, an employer may not want payroll  
coverage for ordinary workers because if the business were temporarily shut down, the workers could be replaced. In

1. Medicaid Reform (rationing)extends Medicaid eligibility to those individuals below the federal poverty level, and  
requires, if possible, that Medicaid benefits be provided through MANAGED CARE plans.  
2. Employer Mandateemployers must provide health insurance for all permanent (working at least 17.5 hours per week)  
employees on a play or pay basis, where the employer plays by providing the employees with a health insurance plan or  
pays by paying a payroll tax that is passed through to the state's Insurance Pool Fund.  
3. Market Reformbenefits available must be substantially similar to those provided by Medicaid.  
The indemnity insurance plan and the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) provide similar benefits, and both plans  
must be accessible to all businesses whose employment is in the range of 3 to 25 employees. The indemnity insurance  
plan has the following characteristics: (1) $15 copayment for preventive services (most other services require a 50%  
copayment); (2) no deductible; (3) out-of-pocket expenses to be limited to $3750 annually on an individual basis and  
$7500 annually on a family basis. After these annual limits have been reached, 100% of the expenses are paid by the  
insurance plan up to a $1,000,000 lifetime maximum; and (4) preventive services to include children's immunizations,  
dental examinations, basic medical examinations, vision examinations through age 18, basic blood pressure and  
cholesterol screening for adults every five years through age 39 and every two years beginning at age 40, maternity  
care, mental health benefits, alcohol and chemical dependence benefits.  
All insurance companies that sell and/or service insurance plans to employers who have 3 to 25 employees must offer at  
least those basic benefits and cannot refuse to sell this plan to any such employer. In addition, no employee or  
employee's dependent can be excluded from the plan; there must be portability from any previous individual or group  
health insurance plan; benefits cannot be denied because of preexisting conditions to include pregnancy; policies cannot  
be cancelled on a selective basis, even for those employees who develop high-risk health care problems; and premium  
rates cannot exceed the geographic premium rate maintained for a stipulated geographic area.  
ORIGINAL AGE insured's age at the date a TERM LIFE INSURANCE policy is issued. An original age or retroactive  
conversion option permits the insured to convert the term policy to a cash value policy as of the original date of issue.  
Conversion is made without a physical examination, but a correction factor is charged to reflect the difference in  
premiums between the policies that would have been payable beginning at the original date of issue. This difference is  
accumulated at interest to reflect the time value of money. See also ATTAINED AGE.  
ORIGINAL AGE CONVERSION see ORIGINAL AGE.

ORIGINAL COST actual price paid for property when it was acquired. The original cost might apply to a piece of  
jewelry, to a piece of equipment, or to a building. For insurance purposes, original cost is often different from  
replacement cost or ACTUAL CASH VALUE.  
ORIGINAL COST LESS DEPRECIATION actual price paid for property when acquired, minus depreciation. Original  
cost less depreciation is used to compute ACTUAL CASH VALUE, which is often the insurable interest in a property.  
OTHER INSURANCE presence of other contract(s) covering the same conditions. When more than one policy covers  
the exposure, each policy will pay an equal share of the loss.  
OTHER INSURANCE CLAUSE provision in a property, liability, or health insurance policy stipulating the extent of  
coverage in the event that other insurance covers the same property. See also APPORTIONMENT; COORDINATION  
OF BENEFITS.  
OTHER INSUREDS individuals or organizations covered by PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE other than  
the named insured. For example, under the PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP), other insureds under  
Coverage ALiability are the named insured's spouse, other relatives living with the insured, and any other person using  
the automobile with the permission of the insured or the insured's spouse. See also RIDERS, LIFE POLICIES.  
OUTAGE INSURANCE see EXTRA EXPENSE INSURANCE.  
OUTBOARD MOTOR BOAT INSURANCE coverage on an ALL RISKS basis for physical damage loss. Coverage  
applies to property damage to the insured boat or damage caused by the insured boat to a third party boat (property  
damage liability). Excluded perils are war damage, use of boat in a race or speed contest, nuclear loss, and so forth.  
Bodily injury liability coverage is excluded from this policy since the operator of the boat would be covered for this risk  
under a COMPREHENSIVE PERSONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE policy, HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE  
POLICY, or TENANTS INSURANCE.

OVERHEAD EXPENSE DISABILITY INCOME POLICY type of DISABILITY INCOME POLICY used to provide  
funds for the ongoing monthly business expenses (such as employee salaries, utility charges, rent, and equipment  
payment due) necessary to maintain continuing operations in the event an owner/key person becomes disabled.  
Generally, there is a 60-day ELIMINATION PERIOD after which monthly income payments commence until a  
stipulated aggregate limit has been reached.  
OVERHEAD INSURANCE see BUSINESS INCOME COVERAGE FORM.  
OVERINSURANCE situation in which insurance benefits exceed the actual loss of an insured. Overinsurance can be a  
problem for the insurer because it may tempt the insured to make a false claim in order to profit financially. Various  
safeguards are designed to prevent overinsurance. For example, in group health insurance, companies break down  
benefits paid by the primary carrier and the secondary carrier through COORDINATION OF BENEFITS. Still, some  
types of coverage, particularly disability income insurance, are subject to overinsurance abuse.  
OVERLAPPING INSURANCE coverage by at least two insurance policies providing the same coverage for the same

OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION (OPIC) federal program to insure private U.S. investments  
in foreign countries, created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. It is a joint government and private effort to  
encourage U.S. investments abroad by providing protection against three political risks: (1) inability to convert foreign  
currency; (2) expropriation of facilities by a foreign country; and (3) war or revolution. The program is guaranteed by  
the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

PAIR CLAUSE see SET CLAUSE (PAIR OR SET CLAUSE).  
PAIRED PLAN plan that combines a PROFIT SHARING PLAN with a MONEY PURCHASE PLAN. It permits the  
participant to maximize the flexible part of the combination (profit sharing plan) after satisfying the requirements for the  
annual contributions to the money purchase plan. Under this combination plan, the maximum annual contribution is  
25% of the earned income subject to a maximum of $30,000. For  
< previous page page_363 next page >

example, if the participant desired to contribute annually the 25% maximum amount of earned income, the participant  
could commit to making a 15% annual contribution to the money purchase plan and then contribute the remainder to the  
profit sharing plan if business conditions permit. The only mandate contribution each year would be the 15% of earned  
income to the money purchase plan.

PARASOL POLICY see DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS INSURANCE.  
PARCEL POST INSURANCE coverage for a shipper (owner/sender) for property damage or loss of goods in transit  
through the post office. A TRIP TRANSIT INSURANCE policy specifically excludes coverages on property sent  
through the post office since that agency is not a common carrier and does not incur the liability of a common carrier.  
This is why additional coverage must be purchased in the form of parcel post insurance, even if a business has a trip  
transit insurance policy. Parcel post insurance is sold by the post office in the form of a certificate, which covers  
property in its custody. It is issued on an ALL RISKS basis, subject to exclusions of spoilage, and financial instruments  
such as bills, currency, deeds, notes, and securities.  
PARENT COMPANY insurer in a group of companies that act as subsidiaries. See also FLEET OF COMPANIES.  
PARENT LIABILITY liability incurred by a parent by reason of a TORT committed by his or her minor child.  
PAROL EVIDENCE RULE rule that prohibits the introduction into a court of law of any oral or written agreement that  
contradicts the final written agreement. For example, an insurance contract containing clauses and provisions is in  
writing, and as such this contract cannot be contradicted or modified by any oral statements or agreements that are  
inadmissible in a court of law.  
PARTIAL DISABILITY see PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY.  
PARTIAL DISABILITY BENEFIT an amount usually expressed as 50% of the MONTHLY INDEMNITY for the  
TOTAL DISABILITY BENEFIT provided by a DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE POLICY. This amount  
becomes payable when the insured wage earner's income has been interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness,  
or accident. Payments continue up to the time and amount limitations as stipulated in the policy. This type of benefit has  
been replaced, in large part, by the RESIDUAL DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE policy.

PARTIAL LOSS damage of property that is not total; average (in sense of partial) loss. See also SET CLAUSE.  
PARTIAL PLAN TERMINATION scheme to recapture excess pension assets by splitting a qualified plan in two, and  
terminating one of them. In the mid-1980s, many pension plans became ''overfunded" because their investments had  
performed so well. In order to recapture the "extra" money, some business firms split the pension plan into two plans,  
one for current employees and an overfunded one for retirees. The company buys annuities to pay the required benefits  
to retirees and reclaims the excess assets. The other plan is kept in place for current employees.  
PARTIAL VESTING a procedure effective January 1, 1989, under the TAX REFORMACT OF 1986. The entitlement  
of an employee to a specified portion of the pension benefits accrues in the following manner: vesting of 20% after the  
completion of three years of service with an employer, increasing by 20% for each year of service thereafter, until 100%  
vesting is achieved at the end of seven years of service.

PARTNERSHIP ENTITY PLAN see PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE.  
PARTNERSHIP INSURANCE see PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE.  
PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE protection to maintain the value of a business in case of death or  
disability of a partner. Upon the death or long-term disability of a partner, insurance can provide for the transfer of a  
deceased or disabled partner's interest to the surviving partner according to a predetermined formula. Funding can be  
achieved through either of two plans:  
1. Cross Purchase Planeach partner buys insurance on the lives of the other partners. The beneficiaries are the surviving  
partners who use the proceeds to buy out the deceased's interest. This plan can become complicated when there are  
more than two partners. For example, if there are four partners, partner A will buy insurance on the lives of partners B,  
C, and D. The procedure would be repeated with partners B, C, and D. Total policies would be 12.  
2. Entity Planbecause of the number of policies required, the entity plan is most often used for buy-and-sell agreements  
by larger partnerships. The partnership owns, is beneficiary of, and pays the premiums on the life insurance of each  
partner. When one of the partners dies, the partnership as a whole purchases the deceased partner's interest. Premiums  
are not tax deductible as a business expense. If whole life insurance is used, the cash values are listed as assets on the  
balance sheet of the partnership and are available as collateral for loans.  
Partners use insurance to fund other objectives. In personal service partnerships of doctors, lawyers, and accountants,  
when it is important to retain a deceased partner's name on the title of the firm, the heirs may agree to this for a share in  
subsequent partner-ship profits. An income continuation insurance plan funded through life insurance by the  
partnership, serves this purpose.  
Disability of partner buy and sell insurance can be used by a partnership to provide income for the firm if a partner  
becomes disabled. The policy would pay a monthly income to the partnership for the duration of the partner's disability.  
PARTY individual or entity who enters into a contract or other legal proceeding, such as a lawsuit.  
PASSENGER BODILY INJURY LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for automobile or aircraft operators if they are  
sued for negligently  
< previous page page_366 next page >  
 
< previous page page_367 next page >  
Page 367  
killing or injuring a passenger. The PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) provides MEDICAL PAYMENTS  
INSURANCE for doctor and hospital bills for passengers of the insured, and BODILY INJURY liability insurance for  
anyone who is accidentally disabled, injured, or killed by the insured. Aviation policies split bodily injury liability into  
general and passenger. Passenger liability covers a passenger who is injured, killed, or disabled; general liability covers  
anyone else.  
PASSIVE LOSS RULES rules passed as part of the TAX REFORMACT OF 1986 that limit the amount of income  
investors can shelter from current tax. Losses can be deducted from passive activities only in the amount to which  
income results from passive activities. Furthermore, losses from one passive activity can be used only to offset the  
passive income earned from a similar passive activity. For example, losses from publicly traded partnerships can be  
applied only to offset passive income earned from publicly traded partnerships.  
PASSIVE RETENTION practice in which no funds are set aside on a mathematical basis to pay for expected losses.  
This occurs when a risk manager is not aware of an exposure, when the cost of treating an exposure positively is  
prohibitive, or if the severity of a loss (should it occur) would be inconsequential. See also SELF INSURANCE.  
PAST DUE ACCOUNTS funds receivable or payable that have not been paid in a timely manner. COMMERCIAL  
CREDIT INSURANCE protects an insured against declines in the value of receivables due to insolvency of a debtor.  
The insured may turn over to the insurer accounts that are up to 12 months past due or, by special endorsement, those  
that are 6 months overdue. For insurance purposes, these past due accounts will be treated as if they were accounts due  
from an insolvent company.  
PAST SERVICE BENEFIT private pension plan credit given for an employee's past service with an employer prior to  
establishment of a pension plan. Usually, a lower percentage of compensation is credited for benefits for past service  
than for future service benefits.  
PAST SERVICE CREDIT see PAST SERVICE BENEFIT.  
PAST SERVICE LIABILITY employer's obligation to fund a pension plan for the time period when employees were  
qualified to participate but the plan was not yet established. For example, a pension plan is established at XYZ Co. in  
1985. Because John Smith started at the firm in 1975, he would have a past service credit for his 10 years of service  
before the plan started. For funding purposes, annual contributions are broken down into FUTURE SERVICE  
BENEFITS and PAST SERVICE BENEFIT. Past service liability is not funded entirely in the initial year of a plan,  
primarily because it would be too expensive, and the IRS requires that deductions be spread over 10 years.  
PAST SERVICE LIABILITYINITIAL funding of an employee's benefits in a pension plan for his or her beginning past  
service of

employment. This is a significant cost factor in pension planning and financing of future benefits.  
PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT see UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE.  
PATENT INSURANCE coverage for a loss incurred by the INSURED resulting from an infringement of the insured's  
patent or coverage for a claim made against the insured resulting from infringement by the insured against another's  
patent.

PAY-AS-YOU-GO PLAN see CURRENT DISBURSEMENT.  
PAY-AT-THE-PUMP PLAN automobile insurance plan, debated for a number of years, that is financed through a  
surcharge of a given number of cents per gallon (estimates run from 30 to 40 cents) to be paid by the purchaser of the  
gasoline. The plan would operate on the NO-FAULT AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE basis. Claims would be paid from  
an insurance pool whose funds would be generated by the surcharge. Drivers would receive unlimited medical  
coverage, up to $25,000, for missed wages and collision damage. Drivers would be required to pay a $250 deductible.  
Those drivers desiring additional lost wages or damage coverage, could purchase it separately.  
PAYEE  
1. recipient.  
2. insurance company that receives a premium payment from a payer.  
3. insured or beneficiary who receives a loss or benefit payment from an insurer.  
PAYEE CLAUSE CLAUSE in an INSURANCE POLICY that provides for the payment of a monetary sum to the  
individual(s) who incurred the loss.  
PAYMASTER ROBBERY INSURANCE coverage for robbery of the payroll of a business. Coverage applies to money  
and checks from the time the payroll is withdrawn from the bank until it is distributed to the employees, whether inside  
or outside of the premises of the business. Employees are covered if robbed of their pay when the business itself  
< previous page page_368 next page >

Page 369  
is being robbed of the payroll. Excluded are manuscripts and records of accounts.  
PAYMENT BOND bond guaranteeing that a contractor will pay fees owed for labor and materials necessary for  
construction of a project. If these fees are not paid, an owner who has paid the contractor might be confronted with  
subcontractor's or worker's liens filed against the completed project. If this happens, the owner could end up paying  
many times the value of the work done. See also PERFORMANCE BOND.  
PAYMENT CERTAIN phrase used to describe a method of annuity payout that guarantees a specified number of years,  
regardless of whether an annuitant remains alive.

PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS ON BONDS act that seals a contract and is noncancellable. SURETY BONDS and  
FIDELITY BONDS resemble insurance contracts in many ways. However, the surety, which is often an insurance  
company, cannot cancel a bond once the premium has been paid.  
PAYOR CLAUSE provision found in JUVENILE INSURANCE that waives the premiums due on the insured child's  
policy provided that the payor of the premiums becomes totally disabled or dies before the child reaches a stipulated age.  
PAYOUT PHASE period when the accumulated assets in an ANNUITY are returned to the annuitant. An annuity may  
be purchased either with a single payment or with many payments over the life of the contract. At some point, usually  
upon retirement, the annuitant elects to have the payments, plus earnings, returned. The 1982 Federal Tax Code  
declared that any money received during the payout phase is considered earnings first and is taxable.  
PAYROLL AUDIT insurance company's examination of an insured business's payroll records in order to determine the  
final premium due on a WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE policy.  
PAYROLL BUYUP DISABILITY INSURANCE basic GROUP DISABILITY INSURANCE policy for all employees  
purchased by the employer. In addition, the employer usually purchases an individual disability policy for key  
executives. Employees purchase supplemental group disability insurance for themselves.

PAYROLL STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (PAYSOP) EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP); TRUST  
(ESOP) under which an employer received tax credit instead of a tax deduction for contributions. Until passage of the  
TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986, the tax credit was limited to the lesser of the value of the stock contributed to the plan  
or .5% of the employer's payroll. The PAYSOP must have met all of the requirements of a qualified plan, and all  
participants must have had 100% immediate VESTING. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed PAYSOP.  
PEAK SEASON ENDORSEMENT endorsement attached to PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERAGE that provides

PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC) independent federal government organization authorized  
by the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) to administer the PENSION PLAN  
TERMINATION INSURANCE program. Its function is to ensure that vested benefits of employees, whose PENSION  
PLAN is being terminated, will be paid as they come due. The PBGC board of directors consists of the U.S. Secretaries  
of Labor, Commerce, and Treasury. Only qualified DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS are guaranteed; PROFIT SHARING  
PLANS, stock bonus plans, and MONEY PURCHASE PLANS are not. Plan termination insurance covers both  
voluntary termination and terminations ordered by the PBGC. Employers pay an annual premium rate per employee in  
their pension plans to the PBGC to finance the plan termination insurance program.  
PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION PARTICIPANT NOTICE REQUIREMENT notice added to the  
EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) requiring the employer to disclose the following  
information concerning the PENSION PLAN to the employee:  
1. the ratio of plan assets to current liability (value of the employer retirement benefits earned to date). This ratio is  
known as the funded percentage.  
2. statement that the employer is responsible for paying all earned pension benefits, but such payment could be at risk  
should the  
< previous page page_370 next page >  
 
< previous page page_371 next page >  
Page 371  
employer have severe financial difficulties. A statement that, if the plan terminates, the PENSION BENEFIT  
GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC) becomes responsible for paying the employees their earned retirement benefits.  
3. statements indicating any late funding of minimum contributions and the date the contributions were paid into the  
plan.  
4. statement of any late quarterly contributions (more than 60 days late) and the actual date contributions were made.  
A plan is subject to this notice requirement for a plan year if the plan paid to the PBGC is a variable premium during  
that plan year and the minimum funding requirement for the plan year is based on the DEFECIT REDUCTION  
CONTRIBUTION for the prior or the current plan year. Plans that are subject to this notice requirement for a plan year  
must notify all plan participants (current employees, VESTED employees who have terminated, retired employees, and  
beneficiaries of deceased employees).  
PENSION EQUITY PLAN (PEP) modifications of the traditional DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN in which employees are  
credited with a specified percentage for each year of recognized service with the employer. Upon termination of service,  
the percentages are summed and multiplied times the final average pay. The resultant calculation is the employee's  
annual retirement benefit. These plans provide for an even accrual of the employee's retirement benefits and thus  
provide greater benefit for employees that have shorter periods of service.  
PENSION FUND see PENSION PLAN.  
PENSION MAXIMIZATION plan under which life insurance is substituted for retirement income. Under the plan, a  
married individual selects a SINGLE LIFE ANNUITY payout from the pension plan, which will generate the maximum  
monthly income benefit while that individual is alive, with nothing being paid to the surviving spouse after the death of  
that individual. The higher income generated from the single life annuity, compared with that from a JOINT LIFE AND  
SURVIVOR-SHIP ANNUITY, is used to buy a life insurance policy on the married individual's life. If this individual  
dies first, the proceeds of the policy will be used to purchase an ANNUITY for the lifetime of the spouse. Should the  
spouse die first, the married individual still has the higher income benefit from the single life annuity.  
PENSION PLAN retirement program to provide employees (and often, spouses) with a monthly income payment for  
the rest of their lives. To qualify, an employee must have met minimum age and service requirements. Benefit formulas  
can be either the DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION (MONEY PURCHASE PLAN) or the DEFINED BENEFIT  
PLAN. The EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) requires a pension plan to  
provide an income for the rest of a retired employee's life, and at least 50% of that amount to the surviving spouse of a  
retired employee for the rest of her life, unless the spouse

< previous page page_372 next page >  
Page 372  
waives this right in writing. Death and disability benefits are also provided by most pension plans. The TAX REFORM  
ACT OF 1986 has changed the VESTING requirements. Funds for these plans can be generated under numerous  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING INSTRUMENTS.  
PENSION PLAN: FUND COLLEGE EDUCATION group of plans (to include SECTION 401(k) PLANS and  
SECTION 403(b) PLANS) that permit in-service withdrawals to fund a college education if a HARDSHIP exists.  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING: GROUP DEPOSIT ADMINISTRATION ANNUITY pension plan funding instrument in  
which contributions paid by an employer are deposited to accumulate at interest. (These plans are usually  
NONCONTRIBUTORY.) Upon retirement, an immediate annuity is purchased for the employee. The benefit is  
determined by a formula, and the investment earnings on funds left to accumulate at interest. Since the annuity is  
purchased at point of retirement, the deposit administration plan can be used with any benefit formula.  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING: GROUP IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION GUARANTEED (IPG) CONTRACT  
ANNUITY modification of the group deposit administration annuity under which an employer participates in the  
investment (which may prove to be adverse as well as favorable), mortality, and expense experience of the plan on an  
immediate basis. Under the IPG, contributions are paid into a fund to which interest is credited. At retirement, an  
IMMEDIATE ANNUITY is purchased for the employee. The size of the benefit will depend on the benefit formula  
used and the investment, mortality, and expense experience of the plan.  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING: GROUP PERMANENT CONTRACT insurance policy under which the value equals the  
benefits to be paid to the plan participants (employees) at normal retirement age, assuming that (1) their rate of earnings  
remains the same until NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE, and (2) the contributions to the plan are sufficient to meet  
funding requirements for benefits under the plan. Adjustments to contributions are made as employee earnings increase.  
Retirement benefits depend on the benefit formula used, and the investment, mortality, and expense experience of the  
plan.  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING: IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION GUARANTEE CONTINGENT ANNUITY see  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING: GROUP IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION GUARANTEED (IPG) CONTRACT  
ANNUITY.  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING: INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT PENSION PLAN retirement plan for an individual based  
on a single contract with a benefit based on current earnings, as if they will remain static until NORMAL  
RETIREMENT AGE. As the earnings of the plan participant  
< previous page page_372 next page >  
 
< previous page page_373 next page >  
Page 373  
increase, additional contracts are purchased (with an increase in the contributions to the plan). The amount of retirement  
benefits depends on the benefit formula used and the investment experience of the company underwriting the plan.  
PENSION PLAN FUNDING INSTRUMENTS means of paying the cost of benefits of pension plan participants  
including retirement, death, and disability. See also GROUP PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE; PENSION PLAN;

PENSION PLAN INTEGRATION WITH SOCIAL SECURITY offset or subtraction of Social Security benefits from  
earned benefits in a qualified pension plan to reduce a pension benefit. Many business firms offset their pension  
payments by the amount of a retiree's Social Security benefit. For example, John Smith has earned a monthly pension  
benefit of $950. His monthly Social Security payment is $688. If his employer applies 100% integration, his pension is  
reduced by the entire Social Security benefit; he will receive $950 minus $688, or $262 monthly. More commonly,  
integration is based on a percentage of Social Security. With 50% integration, 50% of the Social Security benefit ($344)  
would be subtracted from the $950 pension for a monthly benefit of $606. Offsets were limited by the TAX REFORM  
ACT OF 1986.  
PENSION PLAN LIMITS dollar limitations under the Internal Revenue Service code as follows:  
1. The elective annual deferral limit is $10,000.  
2. A highly compensated employee's annual compensation limit is $80,000.  
3. QUALIFIED PLANS and SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION (SEP) plan annual compensation limit for  
contributions is $160,000.  
4. SIMPLIFIED RETIREMENT ACCOUNT annual compensation limitation is $6000.  
5. SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION (SEP) plan annual compensation minimum is $400.  
6. State, local government, and tax-exempt organizations' annual limitation on deferrals under DEFERRED  
COMPENSATION PLANS is $8000.  
7. The DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN maximum annual benefit under Section 415 (b)(1)(a) is $130,000.  
8. The DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN maximum annual contribution under Section 415 (c)(1)(a) is $30,000.

9. The maximum account balance dollar amount permitted for determining the tax credit under an EMPLOYEE STOCK  
OPTION PLAN (ESOP) subject to a five-year period of distribution is $735,000.  
PENSION PLANS: DISTRIBUTIONS prior to 1988, right to withdraw retirement assets before age 59 1/2 without  
having to pay a 10% penalty under the following circumstances:  
1. medical expenses are incurred.  
2. the plan participant becomes disabled. With the passage of the TECHNICAL AND MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE  
ACT OF 1988 (TAMRA): EMPLOYEE BENEFITS a third option is available to the plan participant:  
3. distribution must be a part of a scheduled series of substantially equal periodic payments. The distributions must be  
made in such a manner that they will continue for the lifetime of the plan participant or the joint lifetime of the plan  
participant and his or her beneficiary.  
PENSION PLANS: WITHDRAWAL BENEFITS rights of employees who leave an employer with a qualified plan to  
withdraw their accumulated benefits. With a CONTRIBUTORY plan, employees have immediate rights to their own  
contributions, plus earnings. If they leave the employer, the accumulated money belongs to them. But they are not  
entitled to employer contributions, unless vested. VESTING depends on the terms of the plan, but maximum time limits  
are set by law. A vested employee who withdraws accumulated benefits upon separation may either pay tax on the  
amount contributed by the employer and spend it, or roll it over into an INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT  
(IRA).  
PENSION PLAN TERMINATION INSURANCE coverage provided by the PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY  
CORPORATION (PBGC) that guarantees participants a certain level of pension benefits even if the plan terminates  
without assets. The PBGC was authorized under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF  
1974 (ERISA). The insurance, paid for by employers, protects vested interest only.  
PENSION PLAN VALUATION FACTORS present value computation of the accrued or projected benefits of a  
retirement plan. This computation is known as the actuarial valuation because it is based on (1) probability (retirement  
event will take place); (2) demographic changes (increase or decrease in employee's earnings); (3) interest rate (discount  
rate used to derive present value of future benefits).  
PENSION PORTABILITY employee's right to transfer pension benefit credits from a former employer to a current  
employer.  
PENSIONS see PENSION PLAN.  
PENSION TRUST provision that funds a tax-qualified plan. Trust funds are the oldest, and still the most common,  
method of funding pensions. All contributions made by employer and employees are deposited into  
< previous page page_374 next page >  
 
< previous page page_375 next page >  
Page 375  
a trust fund, with a trustee responsible for investing the money, administering the plan, and paying benefits.  
PER ACCIDENT LIMIT maximum amount that an insurance company will pay under a liability insurance policy for  
claims resulting from a particular accident. This maximum amount applies regardless of the amount of property damage  
or the number of persons injured in that accident.  
PER CAPITA distribution of a deceased beneficiary's share of an estate among all of his or her living heirs. Contrast  
with PER STIRPES.  
PER CAUSE DEDUCTIBLE requirement that the deductible must be met for each separate illness or accident before  
benefits are payable under major medical insurance.  
PERCENTAGE-OF-LOSS DEDUCTIBLE deductible, applied to every loss, expressed as a percentage of that loss. As  
the loss increases, the deductible amount increases.  
PERCENTAGE PARTICIPATING DEDUCTIBLE (stop loss) amount over which a health insurance plan pays 100%  
of the costs in a PERCENTAGE PARTICIPATION plan. Here, an insured shares costs with the insurer according to  
some predetermined ratio. For example, an insured may pay 20% of covered costs and the insurer 80%. However, most  
group medical plans pick up all covered expenses over a certain deductible amount or specified dollar limit. For  
example, once the insured has paid a $2000 deductible amount, the plan may pay 100% of covered expenses for the  
remainder of the policy year.  
PERCENTAGE PARTICIPATION (COINSURANCE) plan where a portion of medical expenses are paid by an  
insured. Some health insurance policies provide that the insured shares expenses with the insurer according to a  
predetermined ratio. For example, many group health plans provide that, after paying a deductible amount, the insured  
pays a portion (usually 20-25%) of covered medical expenses. For some types of services, such as psychiatry or  
dentistry, the percentage participation, which the insured pays, may go as high as 50% of covered services.  
PER DIEM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION POLICY type of BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE policy that  
provides a specific daily dollar amount benefit to the business owner for each day the business is unable to resume  
normal business operations because of property damage or destruction resulting from an INSURED PERIL.  
PERFORMANCE BOND bond guaranteeing that a contractor will perform under the contract in accordance with all  
specifications of the bid submitted.

injury or illness suffered. See also DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE.  
PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LIMIT (PEL) standard set under the OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT  
that sets allowable levels of worker exposure to such toxic substances as asbestos, certain chemicals, and radiation. In  
many cases workers must wear devices to determine their exposure to toxic workplace substances, and when the  
maximum is reached, they must be transferred to another workplace. Business firms that violate the standard can be  
fined.  
PERMISSIBLE LOSS RATIO see EXPECTED LOSS RATIO.  
PERMISSION GRANTED CLAUSE provision in most property insurance policies on real property that permits a  
policyholder to use an insured place for normal purposes related to occupancy. This might include storing remodeling  
materials or hobby equipment. This clause is important because a policy may be voided for fraud, concealment, or  
misrepresentation. A policy may also be suspended for increased hazard by an insured. The permission granted clause  
provides a defense against a charge that a policyholder has increased the hazard of covered property if the materials in  
question are a part of the insured's everyday lifestyle.  
PERMISSIVE LAW see FILE-AND-USE RATING LAWS.  
PERMISSIVE USER person who uses personal property such as an automobile with permission of an owner. For  
example, for insurance purposes, someone who uses an automobile with the owner's permission would be covered by  
the latter's PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP). On the other hand, the owner of property may not be  
responsible for a TRESPASSER.  
PERMIT BOND contract guaranteeing that a person licensed by a city, county, or state agency will perform activities  
for which the bond was granted, according to the regulations governing the license.  
PER PERSON LIMIT maximum amount that an insurance company will pay under a liability insurance policy for  
bodily injury incurred by any single person as a result of any one accident.

PERPETUAL INSURANCE coverage on real property written to have no time limit. A single deposit premium pays  
for insurance for the life of the risk. The insurer earns enough investment income on the deposit to cover losses and  
costs. Upon cancellation, the insured is entitled to return of the initial deposit premium. Perpetual insurance, first issued  
in the U.S. in Philadelphia in 1752, is still used for fire and home-owner's insurance.  
PERPETUAL MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY type of MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY that requires a  
substantial initial premium payment. After the initial premium payment is made, future premium payments required will  
be paid from the investment earnings of the initial premium payment. See also PERPETUAL INSURANCE.  
PER RISK EXCESS INSURANCE see EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE.  
PERSISTENCY percentage of life insurance or other insurance policies remaining in force; percentage of policies that  
have not lapsed. The higher the percentage, the greater the persistency. Since it is an important measure of a company's  
retention of its life insurance business, most companies extend every effort to increase persistency. See also  
CONSERVATION.  
PERSISTENCY BONUSES (ENHANCEMENTS) financial incentives credited to the policy to encourage the  
POLICYOWNER to keep the policy in force. The incentives may be utilized by: (1) applying them to the policy cash  
value after a stipulated time period that the policy has been in force has expired; (2) after a stipulated minimum number  
of premium payments has been paid into the policy; or (3) after the policy's cash value has attained a stipulated  
minimum value. These financial incentives may be added to the policy in the following manner:  
1. Additional interest may be added to the policy's cash value.  
2. Mortality credit may be added to the policy's cash value.  
3. The policy's death benefit may be increased.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) replacement for the earlier Family Automobile Policy (FAP) with these  
nine basic coverages:  
1. Coverage ALiability. (a) The company pays damages for which an insured becomes legally obligated because  
negligent acts or omissions resulted in bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party; (b) the company defends  
the insured against liability suits for damages caused to the third party, paying various expenses in this connection; and  
(c) vehicles covered include the insured's own cars, a newly acquired car, and a temporary substitute car.  
2. Coverage BMedical Payments. The company pays medical expenses for bodily injury incurred by the insured  
(including spouse and relatives) and any other person while they occupy the insured car.  
3. Coverage CUninsured Motorist Coverage. The company pays damages that the insured is legally entitled to collect  
from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.  
4. Coverage DComprehensive. The company pays for loss to the insured's car for all damages, in excess of a deductible  
amount, except due to collision.  
5. Coverage ECollision. The company pays for loss to the insured's car for all damages in excess of a deductible amount  
caused by collision.  
6. Coverage FCar Rental Expense (optional). The company pays for car rental up to a daily dollar limit, when the  
insured's car cannot run due to a loss incurred.  
7. Coverage GDeath, Dismemberment, and Loss of Sight (optional). The company pays the insured or beneficiary for  
death or loss caused by an accident to the insured.  
8. Coverage HTotal Disability (optional). The company pays the insured a monthly disability income benefit because of  
bodily injury in an accident while occupying or being struck by a motor vehicle.  
9. Coverage ILoss of Earnings (optional). The company pays the insured a percentage of his or her loss of monthly  
earnings because of bodily injury as the result of an accident while occupying or being struck by a motor vehicle.  
PERSONAL CATASTROPHE INSURANCE excess coverage over the first layer of medical insurance to provide for  
catastrophic medical payments. The first layer may be either group or individual medical insurance, or an individual  
may choose to pay for ordinary medical payments and buy insurance for those losses above a certain amount.  
PERSONAL COMPREHENSIVE LIABILITY INSURANCE see COMPREHENSIVE PERSONAL LIABILITY  
INSURANCE.

For example, a HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY cannot be transferred with the home upon its sale because the  
insured no longer has an insurable interest (expectation of monetary loss) in the home. But a LIFE INSURANCE  
contract can be assigned (for example, to secure a line of credit for a business). Banks use the American Bankers Form  
for the assignment of life insurance policies pledged as security for a loan.  
PERSONAL EFFECTS INSURANCE coverage outside an insured's home for personal items usually carried or worn  
while traveling. Protection is for personal property (apparel and jewelry), not for real property or property not usually  
carried by the traveler (a piano, household furniture). Coverage applies anywhere in the world for the named insured  
and insured's spouse and unmarried children if residents of the household.  
PERSONAL EXCESS LIABILITY INSURANCE see UMBRELLA LIABILITY INSURANCE.

PERSONAL PRODUCING GENERAL AGENT (PPGA) individual appointed by the insurance company as an  
independent contractor. The agent receives various expense allowances for office-associated expenses and direct  
commissions on products sold as well as overriding commissions on products sold by other company agents. The PPGA  
usually has contracts to sell products from many different insurance companies. Insurance companies usually make  
available to the PPGA advanced sales technical support by supplying technicians and computer software and, in some  
instances, computer hardware.  
PERSONAL PROPERTY see HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY; PERSONAL ARTICLES INSURANCE;  
PERSONAL EFFECTS INSURANCE; PERSONAL PROPERTY FLOATER.  
PERSONAL PROPERTY FLOATER coverage for all personal property, regardless of location of an insured and  
household residents, including children away at school. Written on an ALL RISKS basis, subject to excluded perils such  
as war, wear and tear, mechanical breakdown, vermin, and nuclear disaster. ''Personal property" includes clothing,  
television, musical instruments, cameras, jewelry, watches, furs, furniture, radios, and appliances. Coverage can be  
extended to damage of real property as the result of theft of personal property.  
PERSONAL-RESIDENCE TRUST trust in which a home is transferred directly to the children while the parent(s)  
remain in the home for a fixed period of time, resulting in a substantially reduced estate tax cost. These trusts have a  
great flexibility in that the home in trust may be sold during the term of the trust, provided the proceeds from the sale is  
reinvested in another home within two years of the sale of the home. The primary drawbacks of this trust are that if the  
parent(s) die before the term of the trust expires, the home is included in the estate of the parent(s), and if the parent(s)  
outlive the term of the trust and has a desire to remain in the home, the parent(s) must rent that home from the children  
at its fair market value.  
During the term of the trust, the parent(s) has the right to the income from the trust's property as well as the use of that  
property. As such, income and expenses associated with that property are reported on the income tax return of the parent  
(s). If the parent(s) is still alive at the time the term of the trust expires, the interest in the home that is transferred to the  
children is valued as a remainder interest. The tax advantage results from this remainder interest as the remainder  
interest in the home is valued at a substantially lower value for federal tax purposes than the full market value of the  
home.

PHANTOM STOCK PLANS plans that are similar to STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) in that an employee  
is granted a contractual right by the employer to a stipulated number of units in the business, which is really a  
percentage of the business. As the value of the business increases, the value of these units increase. At the end of a  
stipulated period of time, the employee either can receive additional income based on the appreciation of the value of  
these units or can convert these units into an equity ownership in the business. Thus, the employee has a vested interest  
in the business increasing in value.

includes legal fees, court costs, and other general expenses. There is a crisis in this type of coverage, in that fewer  
companies are writing these policies. See also MALPRACTICE LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
PIA see PRIMARY INSURANCE AMOUNT (PIA); PROFESSIONAL INSURANCE AGENTS (PIA).  
PIERS, WHARVES, DOCKS, AND SLIPS INSURANCE coverage in the event of damage or destruction resulting

perils are included under the Standard Fire Policy and the other business property policies. Piers, wharves, docks, and

employer that would encourage the employer to replace the current health carrier. The POS offers three options for the  
delivery of health care:  
1. traditional gatekeeper (GK) optionHMO network provides the care and there is a gatekeeper director.  
2. open access (OA) optionHMO network provides the care but there is no gatekeeper director. At the time care is  
required, the member selects the provider.  
3. out-of-network option (OON)care is permitted outside the HMO network and there is no gatekeeper director. At the  
time care is required, the member selects the provider.  
The member has increasing payments under the OA and OON options as compared with the GK option. For example,  
the GK option may have a $15 physician COPAYMENT and provide total hospital benefits. The OA option may have a  
$30 physician copayment with a 10% COINSURANCE requirement. The OON option may provide for a $500  
DEDUCTIBLE, an 80/20 coinsurance requirement until the employee's out-of-pocket medical expenses reach $5000,  
and then the plan would pay all expenses up to a $750,000 lifetime maximum.

death benefit.  
The policyowner may repay the loan in whole or in part at any time; or may continue the loan, as long as the interest  
plus the principal of the loan do not equal or exceed the cash value (in essence only the interest on the loan must be  
serviced) or until the policy matures. Insurance companies reserve the right to delay payment of a policy loan for up to  
six months to protect their solvency, but this has rarely been done since the Depression of the 1930s. See also

POLICY STRUCTURE general arrangement of a contract between an insurer and an insured. The policy defines the  
insured and the type of coverage, lays out what the insurer must do, lists exceptions and limitations, and states the  
conditions for coverage. In a standard property and liability contract, the provisions are grouped into these four  
categories: DECLARATION, INSURING AGREEMENT, EXCLUSIONS, and CONDITIONS FOR  
QUALIFICATION.  
POLICY SUMMARY policy report issued to the POLICYOWNER that must include at least the following: (1) first  
five years of premiums, cash values, death benefits, and dividends (if PARTICIPATING INSURANCE); (2) tenth year,  
twentieth year, and at least one year between the insured's age 60 and 65 and policy maturity year of premiums, cash  
values, death benefits, and dividends (if participating insurance); (3) effective interest rate at which POLICY LOANS  
may be made by the policyowner; (4) tenth and twentieth year cost surrender value; (5) the net premium payment cost  
indices; (6) insurance company name and address; (7) the insurance agent name and address; and (8) the type (generic)  
of life insurance policy.  
POLICY TERM see POLICY PERIOD.  
POLICY YEAR see POLICY YEAR EXPERIENCE.  
POLICY YEAR EXPERIENCE 12-month loss on a policy or line of business.  
POLITICAL RISK investment risk associated with the changes in government policies that may have a dramatic effect  
on financial instruments. For example, if federal legislation is passed removing the tax-exempt status of tax-deferred  
buildup of the cash values in LIFE INSURANCE policies and ANNUITIES, one of the primary reasons for purchase of  
these products would be eliminated.  
POLITICAL RISK INSURANCE coverage for business firms operating abroad to insure them against loss due to  
political upheavals including war, revolution, confiscation, incontrovertibility of currency, and other such losses. See  
also OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION.  
POLITICAL RISK INSURANCE: CONFISCATION, EXPROPRIATION AND NATIONALIZATION insurance  
coverage that protects a company's and/or individual's assets against financial loss resulting from acts of confiscation,  
expropriation, or nationalization by a foreign government. Asset protected may be mobile or permanent and include:  
structures, inventory, bank accounts, prepaid supplies, receivables, vacation homes owned by individuals, and personal  
belongings of employees on overseas assignment. The coverage may be purchased on a single asset basis or several  
asset basis worldwide, subject to limits per country and an aggregate policy limit.

Page 388  
POLITICAL RISK INSURANCE: CONTINGENCY INSURANCE insurance coverage that protects a contractor or  
other type of business providing a service for expenses incurred in the event a contract is not ratified by a foreign  
government. For example, if a contractor decides to start building a structure prior to the foreign government ratifying  
the agreement and the ratification fails, the contractor would be indemnified for expenses incurred.  
POLITICAL RISK INSURANCE: CONTRACT FRUSTRATION insurance coverage that will INDEMNIFY the  
INSURED in the event a foreign government or company does not abide by the terms and conditions of the contract in  
such instances as:  
1. Exportationexporter incurs a loss because the buyer in a foreign country does not adhere to the contractual  
obligations.  
2. Deterioration and repudiationinsured sells services to buyer who refuses to honor contractual obligations.  
3. Importationinsured incurs a loss resulting from the nondelivery of products purchased and paid for in advance.  
POLITICAL RISK INSURANCE: UNFAIR CALLING OF DEMAND BONDS insurance coverage that protects the  
exporter (even though the exporter may be in total compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract) in the  
event a foreign government calls the demand bonds. For example, after the Shah of Iran was over-thrown, the new  
government called in the demand bonds posted by United States exporters and contractors to show its animosity toward  
the United States.  
POLLUTION EXCLUSION liability insurance exception for pollution coverage that is not both sudden and accidental  
from the insured's standpoint. As a result of the damage suits from such incidents as the chemical pollution at Love  
Canal, insurance companies began to modify pollution coverage in their liability policies in the 1970s. First, companies  
changed coverage to apply only if pollution was "sudden and accidental," rather than "gradual." But some courts ruled  
that "sudden and accidental" could encompass several years of pollution problems. Consequently, the INSURANCE  
SERVICES OFFICE (ISO) introduced a new COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE (CGL)  
policy in 1985 (replaced today by the COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY form) that excluded coverage for nearly  
all types of pollution damage, leaving only limited liability coverage for pollution originating away from an insured's  
premises.  
POOL syndicate or association of insurance companies or REINSURANCE companies organized to underwrite a  
particular risk, usually with high limits of exposure. Each member shares in premiums, losses, and expenses according  
to a predetermined agreement.  
POOLED INCOME FUNDS separate trust established by a charitable entity whose purpose is to receive contributions  
from numerous  
< previous page page_388 next page >  
 
< previous page page_389 next page >  
Page 389  
donors. All the donors' contributions are commingled. Each donor can retain a life-income interest in the donation. The  
donor's income payment is based on the number of units of participation calculated at the time the donation is made and  
the value of each unit. The value of each unit in turn is determined by the investment performance of the commingled  
funds.  
POOLED INVESTMENT ACCOUNT combination of the funds of many POLICYHOLDERS held in a single account  
and invested as a single entity.  
POOLING method by which each member of an insurance POOL shares in each and every risk written by the other  
members of the pool.  
POOLING CHARGE amount that each member of a POOL contributes to that pool. See also POOLING.  
POPULATION DECREMENTS reduction in a retirement plan's population resulting from the death, disability, and  
termination of its members.  
POPULATION INCREMENTS additions of new entrants into an EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN.

PORTFOLIO insurance company's total investments in financial securities.  
PORTFOLIO AVERAGE METHOD see PORTFOLIO RATE OF RETURN.  
PORTFOLIO RATE FIXED ACCOUNT account in which the same interest rate is credited on all premiums regardless

PORTFOLIO RATE OF RETURN weighted average of the returns earned on the insurance company's investments in  
stocks, bonds, real estate, etc., made at different times and earning different rates of return at these times. It has been  
argued that this rate of return does not reflect the true rate of return on investments being earned today. This led to the  
development of the CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS products.  
PORTFOLIO REINSURANCE coverage in which an insurance company's portfolio is ceded to a reinsurer who  
reinsures a given percentage of a particular line of business.  
PORTFOLIO RETURN process whereby a CEDING COMPANY resumes the insuring of a portfolio of insurance  
policies which it had previously CEDED to a REINSURER.  
PORTFOLIO RUNOFF process of the continual REINSURANCE of a CEDING COMPANY'S portfolio of insurance  
policies. All premiums that have been CEDED become EARNED PREMIUMS.

POSTRETIREMENT FUNDING method of funding a pension plan after a worker retires. An employer purchases an  
annuity or sets aside a sum when an employee retires that will pay monthly lifetime benefits. Postretirement funding is  
no longer permitted under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA), which  
requires current funding of future pension liabilities.  
POSTSELECTION OF INSURED underwriting practice involving regular review of insurance contracts in force with  
the intent of either canceling a policy or not offering renewal for risks no longer deemed acceptable. See also

POWER INTERRUPTION INSURANCE ENDORSEMENT addition to boiler and machinery insurance that covers  
loss to property or equipment caused by an interruption of power by a public utility. Coverage is available either on an  
hourly or daily basis for loss of use or for actual loss sustained.  
POWER OF APPOINTMENT see ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION.  
POWER OF ATTORNEY legal instrument whereby an individual is given the right to act on behalf of another  
individual. For example, the right to buy and sell stock and to sign all brokerage papers relating to buying and selling in  
a stockholder's account is given by the stockholder to another individual through power of attorney. Or the right to  
decide which settlement option is to be used under a life insurance policy may be given by a policyowner to another  
individual. Experts often advise extreme care in assigning a power of attorney since that person becomes free to make  
financial decisions that can enhanceor ruin an individual represented.

PREAUTHORIZED CHECK PLAN plan for the automatic payment of premiums due through drafting by the insurer of  
the policyowner's preauthorized bank account. Usually, the insurer drafts this account on a monthly basis for the  
premium payment owed. Studies show that PERSISTENCY is highest when premium payments are made through bank  
draft plans.  
PREAUTHORIZED CHECK SYSTEM (PAC) arrangement by which a policyowner authorizes an insurance company  
to draft his checking account for premiums due on an insurance policy. The drafting is usually monthly.  
PERSISTENCY of policies paid this way is substantially higher than when insureds pay them directly to an insurance  
company.  
PREDICTABILITY see EXPECTED LOSS.  
PREEXISTING CONDITION illnesses or disability for which the insured was treated or advised within a stipulated  
time period before making application for a life or health insurance policy. A preexisting condition can result in  
cancellation of the policy.  
PREFERENCE BENEFICIARY CLAUSE see BENEFICIARY: BENEFICIARY CLAUSE.  
PREFERRED BENEFICIARY see BENEFICIARY; BENEFICIARY CLAUSE.  
PREFERRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION (PPO) hospital, physician, or other provider of health care that an insurer  
recommends to insureds. A PPO allows insurance companies to negotiate directly with hospitals and physicians for  
health services at a lower price than would be normally charged. A PPO tries to combine the best elements of a fee-forservice  
and HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) systems.  
PREFERRED RISK insured, or an applicant for insurance, with lower expectation of incurring a loss than the standard  
applicant. For example, an applicant for life insurance who does not smoke can usually obtain a reduced premium rate  
to reflect his or her greater LIFE EXPECTANCY.  
PRELIMINARY TERM life insurance accounting method that does not require any TERMINAL RESERVE for a  
policy at the end of the first year. First-year policy acquisition expenses, such as agent commission, MEDICAL  
EXAMINATION, and PREMIUM TAX, are often too large to leave enough of the end-of-the-year PREMIUM for  
addition to the premium reserve required under state FULL VALUATION RESERVE standards. In order to avoid  
taking the difference between the amount of the premium remaining and the required addition to reserves out of the  
insurance company's SURPLUS ACCOUNT, the FULL PRELIMINARY TERM  
< previous page page_391 next page >

Page 392  
RESERVE VALUATION method is sometimes used. This leaves more of the premium available to cover acquisition  
cost and first-year claims. See also MODIFIED RESERVE METHODS.  
PREMISES AND OPERATIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE part of a business liability policy that covers an insured  
for bodily injury or property damage liability to members of the public while they are on his premises. This coverage is  
available in basic business policies that include COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE (CGL);  
MANUFACTURERS AND CONTRACTORS LIABILITY INSURANCE; OWNERS, LANDLORDS, AND  
TENANTS LIABILITY POLICY; STOREKEEPERS LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
PREMISES LIABILITY see LIABILITY, BUSINESS EXPOSURES; LIABILITY, PERSONAL EXPOSURES.  
PREMISES MEDICAL PAYMENTS INSURANCE supplemental coverage written into or endorsed onto many  
business and personal liability policies. Covers medical costs and loss of income of persons injured on an insured's  
property, regardless of whether the insured was at fault in causing those injuries. This coverage enables the insured to  
volunteer to pay these medical costs and income losses when doing so serves the insured's business purposes or  
preserves personal relationships.  
PREMISES SOLD EXCLUSION in a COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY (COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL  
LIABILITY) policy, exclusion of coverage for sold premises. The objective of this exclusion is to eliminate coverage  
for property damage and/or bodily injury due to inherently dangerous risks associated with property sold by the insured.  
For example, the insured may sell property that has defects that should have been repaired prior to the sale. These  
defects could then result in damage to the property, as well as bodily injury to a person or persons who came in contact  
with that property.  
PREMIUM rate that an insured is charged, reflecting his or her expectation of loss or risk. The insurance company will  
assume the risks of the insured (length of life, state of health, property damage or destruction, or liability exposure) in  
exchange for a premium payment. Premiums are calculated by combining expectation of loss and expense and profit  
loadings. Usually, the periodic cost of insurance is computed by multiplying the premium rate per unit of insurance by  
the number of units purchased. The rate class in which the insured is placed includes large numbers of individuals with  
like characteristics who pose the same risk. Every individual in a given class will not incur the same loss; rather each  
has approximately the same expectation of loss (known as the Principle of Equity). See also EQUITY; GROSS  
PREMIUM; PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD.  
PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT ENDORSEMENT provision in an insurance policy allowing an INITIAL PREMIUM to be  
charged, but subject to  
< previous page page_392 next page >

adjustment during the period of coverage or at the end of coverage depending on the actual loss experience of the  
insured risk.

PREMIUM COMPUTATION see PREMIUM; PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD.  
PREMIUM DEFAULT see DISCONTINUANCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS; LAPSE.  
PREMIUM DEFICIENCY RESERVE supplementary life insurance reserve required by state regulators when the  
GROSS PREMIUM is lower than the VALUATION PREMIUM. Some life insurers are able to charge policyholders a  
premium that is lower than required by the reserve valuation system they use. This may be because mortality tables are  
outdated and their own experience reflects different loss statistics. But if the insurer charges a premium lower than that  
dictated in the calculation of policy reserves, it must set up a deficiency reserve for the difference.  
PREMIUM DEPOSIT see DEPOSIT PREMIUM.  
PREMIUM DEPOSIT RIDER RIDER attached to an ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE policy that allows the  
POLICYOWNER to deposit excess premium payments into a separate account from which they can be withdrawn to  
meet premium payment requirements.  
PREMIUM DISCOUNT reduction in rate reflecting the present value of a premium due on an annuity one year hence.  
PREMIUM DISCOUNT PLAN plan whereby adjustments are made in the premium, as the premium increases to reflect  
the nonproportionate increases in expenses. Generally, the expenses of acquisition costs, administrative costs of placing  
the policy on the insurer's books, taxes, and claims do not increase in proportion to the increase in the premium. Thus,  
the GROSS PREMIUM should not reflect a proportionate increase in expenses as the NET SINGLE PREMIUM  
increases.

PRESENT INTEREST (GIFT) see ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION; GIFT; GIFT TAX.  
PRESENT VALUE see PRESENT VALUE FACTOR.  
PRESENT VALUE FACTOR discount interest rate factor used to determine the present value of a sum in the future.  
The present value equation is:  
where: P = present value of a sum in the future (discounted value of R) R = sum of money in the future (accumulated  
value at the end of N periods)  
N = number of periods a sum of money is to be discounted in the future i = interest rate per period For example, if one  
wished to determine a sum (P) that must be invested today in order for it to accumulate to $1000 (R) at the end of 20  
years, (N) assuming an 8% interest rate (i), then the equation is:  
PRESENT VALUE OF ANNUITY DUE present value of a series of payments such that the first payment is due  
immediately, the second payment one period from hence, the third payment two periods hence, and so forth. The  
continued payment is contingent upon the designated beneficiary (the ANNUITANT) continuing to live. See also  
PRESENT VALUE OF ANNUITY IMMEDIATE.

PRESUMPTIVE DISABILITY assumption of total disability when an insured loses sight, hearing, speech, or a limb.  
When such a loss occurs to an insured with disability income insurance, the insurer often assumes that the individual is  
disabled, even if he or she later returns to work. Here insurers may pay a lump sum in addition to monthly disability  
payments for the maximum benefit period set by the policy.

COMMISSION) authority to sell additional insurance in excess of the amount of pool coverage available. See also  
MUTUAL ATOMIC ENERGY REINSURANCE POOL; NUCLEAR ENERGY LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
PRICING INADEQUACY RISK one of four types of risks affecting the life insurance company as identified by the  
SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES. This risk is associated with losses that the life insurance company may incur as the result  
of the premium rates charged not being sufficient to pay for the adverse changes in MORTALITY experience,  
MORBIDITY experience, inflation effects on health care claims, changes in social values and their general adverse  
effects on claims, etc. See also ASSET DEPRECIATION RISK; GENERAL BUSINESS RISK; INTEREST RATE  
CHANGE RISK.  
PRIESTLY v. FOWLER 1837 British case that established that an employer was not responsible for injury to an  
employee if the injury  
< previous page page_396 next page >  
 
< previous page page_397 next page >  
Page 397  
was caused by another employee. Prior to this, English common law provided that an employer took responsibility for  
his employees; Priestly v. Fowler was the first crack in that relationship. Later, other exceptions to employer  
responsibility were established until finally the employee shouldered all responsibility for his own welfare because, it  
was argued, he or she had, after all, agreed to accept the job. Late in the 19th century in Great Britain, and early in the  
20th century in the U.S., workers compensation laws were passed in which the employer accepts responsibility for onthe- 
job injuries and pays benefits according to an established schedule. In exchange, the employee accepts this as the  
exclusive remedy. However, in the past decade there have been many challenges to this system, including cases in  
which injured employees have been allowed to sue their employers.  
PRIMA see PUBLIC RISK AND INSURANCE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION (PRIMA).  
PRIMA BENEFICIARY see BENEFICIARY.  
PRIMACY property, liability, or health coverage that takes precedence when more than one policy covers the same  
loss. In order to avoid OVERINSURANCE, or paying an insured more than the actual loss, the covering policies accept  
responsibility for insurance in an established order. For example, if a husband and wife cover each other as dependents  
in group medical insurance, the injured person's own policy assumes primacy. Therefore if the wife gave birth to a  
child, her policy would apply to obstetrical and hospital fees up to its limits. Only then would the husband's policy  
apply, covering the amount that had not been paid by his wife's policy up to the limits of his plan.  
PRIMARY BENEFICIARY see BENEFICIARY.  
PRIMARY INSURANCE property or liability coverage that provides benefits (usually after a deductible has been paid  
by an insured) up to the limits of a policy, regardless of other insurance polices in effect. See also APPORTIONMENT;  
COORDINATION OF BENEFITS; EXCESS INSURANCE; GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE.  
PRIMARY INSURANCE AMOUNT (PIA) monthly benefit payable to retired or disabled worker under Social  
Security. It is calculated by using the average monthly earnings of the covered person while working. Under this  
formula, lower-income workers receive a greater percent of the income they had earned while employed than do more  
highly paid workers. Benefits for spouse, other dependents, and survivors are figured as a percentage of the PIA. A  
worker who takes early retirement may receive a portion of the PIA at age 62. The PIA is used to calculate most other  
benefits.

PRINCIPLE OF INSURABLE INTEREST see INSURABLE INTEREST.  
PRIOR ACTS COVERAGE liability insurance coverage for claims arising from acts that occurred before the beginning  
of the policy period. Policies written on a claims made basis, such as MALPRACTICE LIABILITY INSURANCE and  
ERRORS AND OMISSIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE, cover only claims during the policy period. Prior acts  
coverage is necessary for covering a claim made during a current policy period for an event that happened before a  
policy was in force.  
PRIOR APPROVAL RATING requirement of state approval of property insurance rates and policy forms before they  
can be used. Individual states regulate insurers and approve their rates. There are three methods of rate approval, in  
addition to prior approval: modified prior approval, open competition, and file and use.  
PRIOR-APPROVAL STATES those states requiring insurers to obtain PRIOR APPROVAL RATING of rates and  
policy forms before they use them. Although most states once fell into this category, many followed the lead of New  
York State in 1969 when it moved to a system of open competition.  
PRIOR CONFINEMENT REQUIREMENT requirement that the insured must have stayed in a hospital or other health  
care facility for at least a specified period of time before being entitled to receive insurance benefits. This requirement is  
usually found in LONG-TERM CARE (LTC) insurance policies.  
PRIOR INCOME average earned monthly income (AEMI) for the tax year in which the insured wage earner has  
income interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or accident. This AEMI is important to the calculation of  
the MONTHLY INDEMNITY benefit and the LOSS OF INCOME amount provided under the DISABILITY INCOME  
INSURANCE policy.

PRIVATE PLACEMENT technique used by insurance companies in the purchasing of debt obligations of corporations  
as a means to: (1) avoid the uncertainties of the market; (2) replace market negotiations with private negotiations; and  
(3) avoid Securities and Exchange Commission restrictions. See also DIRECT PLACEMENT.  
PRIVATE REPLACEMENT VARIABLE LIFE (PPVL) life insurance policy in which the CASH VALUE and in some  
circumstances the DEATH BENEFIT will vary according to the investment performance of an underlying portfolio  
usually comprised of equities. Thus, this product is considered to be a VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE policy. In order  
for a PPVL policy to be sold in any state, the insurance company must be approved to distribute that product in the state  
and the product must be approved for distribution. Section 817 of the Internal Revenue Code, which discusses the tax  
treatment of variable policies, and Regulation 1.817.5, which discusses the diversification requirements for life  
insurance policies, VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITIES, and ENDOWMENT INSURANCE POLICIES, pertain to the  
tax considerations for the PPVL. All variable life insurance policies are considered securities and are subject to federal  
securities law. One life insurance product currently being directed on a private placement basis is CORPORATEOWNED  
VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
PROBABILITY chance that an event will occur. The foundation of insurance is probability and STATISTICS. By  
pooling a large number of homogeneous exposures an insurance company can predict with a given degree of accuracy  
the chance that a policyholder will incur a loss. The company reflects this expectation in the pure cost of insurance,  
known as the pure premium. The chance that an event will occur can be expressed as follows:  
For example, the probability of rolling a six on one die can be expressed as:

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION outcomes of an experiment and their probabilities of occurrence. If the experiment  
were to be repeated any number of times, the same probabilities should also repeat. For example, the probability  
distribution for the possible number of heads from two tosses of a fair coin having both a head and a tail would be as  
follows:

PRODUCT RECALL EXCLUSION exception in general liability policies for all expenses associated with product  
recall. In recent years, there have been increasing instances of federal recalls. In addition, there have been many  
instances of deliberate tampering and of manufacturers issuing their own recalls. In either event, the cost of identifying  
the products, communicating with consumers, inspecting the returned products, and repairing or replacing them can be  
enormous. These costs are excluded from general liability policies, but PRODUCT RECALL INSURANCE can be  
purchased for this purpose.  
PRODUCT RECALL INSURANCE coverage for the expenses incurred by a business resulting from the recall of  
products, whether defective or not. See also PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE; PRODUCT AND COMPLETED

PROFITABILITY UNDERWRITING degree of UNDERWRITING profit that an insurance company's book of

PROFITS AND COMMISSIONS FORM coverage protecting future profits to be earned from a manufacturer's  
inventory. A manufacturer may lose all or part of an inventory of finished goods due to a peril such as fire and still be  
able to operate. But in the event that an inventory and other merchandise is destroyed by an insured peril, the insured is  
indemnified for the loss profit or commissions.  
PROFITS AND COMMISSIONS INSURANCE see PROFITS AND COMMISSIONS FORM.  
PROFIT SHARING/MONEY PURCHASE COMBINATION PLAN joint PROFIT SHARING and MONEY  
PURCHASE plan that is appropriate for businesses that desire the funding flexibility of the profit sharing plan and the  
higher tax-deductible (25% vs. 15%) contribution of the money purchase plan. This combination of the two plans  
provides that the profit sharing contributions remain discretionary and the money purchase contributions remain  
mandatory.  
PROFIT-SHARING PLAN arrangement by an employer in which employees share in profits of the business. To be a  
qualified plan, a predetermined formula must be used to determine contributions to the plan and benefits to be  
distributed, once a participant attains a specified age, becomes ill or disabled, severs employment, retires, or dies. When  
a profit-sharing plan is first installed, employees with considerable past service usually do not receive such credit. An  
advantage to an employer is that in low or no profit years, the business does not have to contribute to the plan, since  
contributions are voluntary and the Internal Revenue Code does not require a minimum contribution, as with a deferred  
benefit plan or a MONEY PURCHASE PLAN.

actions between the trust plan and the disqualified person include the sale, lending, exchange, and leasing of goods or  
services between the two parties.  
PROJECTED DIVIDEND estimated future dividends to be paid by a PARTICIPATING INSURANCE POLICY. These  
dividend estimations cannot be part of the policy since they are not guaranteed. They are normally shown in a separate  
computer printout and are only as accurate as the basic interest rate assumptions made.  
PROJECTION FACTORS expectations of investment return, mortality experience, and expenses used in projecting  
future cash values for life insurance and annuities. These projections cannot be part of the actual policy since they are  
not guaranteed. Rather, they take the form of separate computer printouts and are used in sales presentations.

insured to reasonably preserve damaged property from further loss, and explosion or riot unless caused by fire. Other  
exclusions may be specified in a policy. Among them are concealment and fraud by the insured; increased hazard by an  
insured's actions; and vacancy in an insured building for at least 60 consecutive days.  
2. RequirementsIn the event of a loss the insured must give immediate written notice to the insurance company; protect  
the insured property from further damage; separate damaged from undamaged property; give the company a complete  
inventory of the damaged or destroyed property, with signed proof of loss within 60 days; and submit to the company's  
examination of damaged or destroyed property.  
3. OTHER INSURANCEIf two or more separate policies over the same loss, each will pay no more than its pro rata  
share of the loss.  
4. SUBROGATIONAfter the company pays the insured for a loss incurred as the result of actions of a third party, the  
company reserves the right to seek recovery for damages against that third party. (The insured has passed the right of  
suit against the third party to the insurance company.)  
5. CancellationThe insured and the insurance company can terminate the policy under specified circumstances. The  
insured can terminate the policy at any time, and will receive a return of part of the premium, less an amount for  
administrative expenses. The insurance company can cancel a property policy by sending the insured written notice at  
least 5 days before the intended date of cancellation. For a liability policy, after the policy has been renewed the first  
time, or has been in force for at least 60 days, the insurance company can cancel only for causes such as failure of an  
insured to pay a premium when due, if an insured is involved in illegal activities, drives while intoxicated, or is under  
the influence of drugs.

PROPERTY DEPRECIATION INSURANCE coverage that provides for replacement of damaged or destroyed  
property on a new replacement cost basis without any deduction for depreciation. This is equivalent to replacement cost  
property insurance.  
PROPERTY INSURANCE indemnifies an insured whose property is stolen, damaged, or destroyed by a covered peril.  
The term property insurance encompasses numerous lines of available insurance.  
PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERAGE coverage for direct or indirect property loss that can be analyzed under the  
following headings:  
1. Perila particular peril may be included or excluded. For example, the Standard Fire Policy names specific perils such  
as fire and lightning; the ALL RISKS policy covers all entities unless specifically excluded.  
2. Propertya policy may cover only specified or scheduled property such as an automobile; all of an insured's personal  
property up to a specified amount on each item regardless of its location (PERSONAL PROPERTY FLOATER); or all  
property of the insured with no specific limit (BLANKET POLICY).  
3. Personthe person covered must be specifically identified as the named insured in a policy. Residents of that  
household also covered are the spouse, relatives of either, and anyone else below the age of 21 under the insured's care,  
custody, and control.  
4. Durationpolicies are usually written for one year; a personal automobile policy is usually for six months.  
5. Limitslimits are stated as a face amount in a policy. The insurer will never pay more than the lesser of the following  
amounts: limits stated in a policy; actual cash value of destroyed or damaged property; or amount resulting from the  
coinsurance formula.  
< previous page page_405 next page >  
 
< previous page page_406 next page >  
Page 406  
6. Locationa policy may cover perils that strike only the premises of the insured, or it may provide off-premises  
coverage subject to a geographic restriction. For example, the personal automobile policy covers only the U.S. and  
Canada.  
7. HAZARDthe exclusions and suspension section states that if the insured increases a covered hazard the company can  
suspend or exclude the coverage. For example, the insured starts processing explosives at home.  
8. LOSSinsurance contracts cover either direct or indirect (CONSEQUENTIAL) loss. For example, a homeowners  
policy covers damage due to the direct loss by fire, lightning, and other perils. It does not cover consequential losses  
such as loss of income by an insured who is unable to go to work because of fatigue.  
PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE system whereby the reinsurer shares losses in the same proportion as it shares  
premium and policy amounts. Proportional reinsurance may be divided into the two basic forms: AUTOMATIC  
PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE and facultative proportional reinsurance. See also REINSURANCE.  
PROPOSAL see APPLICATION.  
PROPOSAL BOND see BID BOND.  
PROPOSITION 103: CALIFORNIA legislation mandating that factors taken into account in the calculation of premium  
rates for automobile insurance include the insured's driving record, annual miles driven, and years of driving  
experience. Excluded from consideration is territorial rating. Also included in the provision is a required dis-count of  
20% for being a good driver. The proposition repeals previous laws which prohibited insurance brokers and agents from  
REBATING premiums or commissions as an inducement to prospective insureds to purchase insurance from them.  
Also repealed by the proposition was the law that prohibited banks from becoming licensed to sell insurance. The  
proposition requires California to be a prior-approval state for any rate changes concerning automobile insurance, as  
well as to submit certain specified rate-change requests to a public hearing.  
PROPRIETARY INSURER for-profit insurance company, such as a mutual or stock company or LLOYD'S OF

CLAUSE; PRO RATA REINSURANCE.  
PRO RATA CANCELLATION revocation of a policy by an insurance company that returns to the policyholder the  
unearned premium (the portion of the premium for the remaining time period that the policy will not be in force). There  
is no reduction for expenses already paid by the insurer for that time period. See also SHORT RATE  
CANCELLATION.

PRO RATA CLAUSE CLAUSE in an INSURANCE POLICY that stipulates that the policy will pay for losses in  
proportion to the amount of insurance coverage that the policy has in force in relation to the total amount of insurance in  
force from all other policies.  
PRO RATA DISTRIBUTION CLAUSE provision in many property insurance policies that automatically distributes  
coverage over insured property at various locations in proportion to their value. For example, if an insured buys a  
$100,000 policy to cover three properties worth $75,000, $30,000 and $20,000, the insurance (which would not be  
enough to cover a total loss) would be distributed in the same manner. If the $75,000 property were totally destroyed,  
the insured would receive 60% of the value of the insurance, or $60,000, because that property represents 60% of the  
covered property. If the insured buys adequate coverage, this clause is important because it can spread the insurance to  
different locations as inventories decrease or increase, rather than forcing the insured to constantly revise the coverage.  
See also DOUBLE RECOVERY.  
PRO RATA LIABILITY CLAUSE provision in many property insurance policies that spreads the obligation to pay a  
claim among various insurers covering that claim in proportion to the insurance each has written on the property. For  
example, there are three different policies covering a $130,000 building. Co. A wrote a $60,000 policy, Co. B a $50,000  
policy, and Co. C a $20,000 policy. A fire results in $25,000 damage. The loss would be spread in the same ratio as the  
coverage: Co. A's share would be $11,750, or 47%; Co. B would pay $9500, or 38%; and Co. C would pay $3750, or  
15%. One purpose of this clause is to prevent an insured from capitalizing on a loss. In the case cited, the insured could  
collect the full amount ($25,000) twice from the first two insurers, and $20,000 from the third, giving him or her  
$70,000 to cover a $25,000 loss.  
PRO RATA RATE premium rate charged for a particular time interval which is less than the normal time interval. For  
example, if the time interval of coverage is one month, the premium due each month would be one-twelfth of the annual  
premium payment.

PROSPECTIVE COMPUTATION see PROSPECTIVE RATING.  
PROSPECTIVE EXPERIENCE RATING see PROSPECTIVE RATING.  
PROSPECTIVE RATING determination of (1) a future property or liability insurance or reinsurance rate or (2) a  
premium for a specified future period of time. It is based on the loss experience of a specified past period of time.  
PROSPECTIVE RESERVE amount designated as a future liability for life or health insurance to meet the difference  
between future benefits and future premiums. NET LEVEL PREMIUM is determined so that this basic relationship  
holds: the present value of a future premium equals the present value of a future benefit. This relationship, incidentally,  
exists in fact only at the point of issuance of a life insurance policy. After that, the value of future premiums is less than  
the value of future benefits because fewer premiums are left to be paid. Thus, a reserve must be maintained at all times  
to make up this difference.  
PROSPECTIVE VALUATION calculations involving the MORTALITY RATE of a company's insureds and the rate of  
return on the company's investments. It is used in calculating the PROSPECTIVE RESERVE.

PROTECTION see COVERAGE.  
PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY INSURANCE (P&I) broad type of marine legal liability coverage. HULL  
MARINE INSURANCE is limited to an insured ship. With the addition of a RUNNING DOWN CLAUSE, a policy can  
be extended to cover liability in case of collision with another ship. But many shipowners desire the much broader  
coverage offered by protection and indemnity insurance since it covers the ship operator for liability to crew members  
and other people on board, damage to fixed objects like docks, and other miscellaneous claims.

PS-58 COST METHOD OF THE SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE PLAN payment of that portion of the annual  
premium by the employee necessary to cover the PS-58 cost for that given year. Any unpaid premium balance for that  
particular year is paid by the employer. See also PS-58 RATE TABLE; SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE.  
PS-58 RATE TABLE table used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in evaluating SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE  
INSURANCE plans as to the extent of the economic benefit that is considered taxable ordinary income to the employee.  
The taxable ordinary income to the employee is the premium cost of one-year term insurance on the life of the  
employee minus that portion of the premium paid by the employee. If the employee pays that portion of the premium  
that is in excess of the economic benefit, the employee incurs no ordinary income tax liability. The premium cost of oneyear  
term insurance at each age is listed in this IRS table.

PUBLIC LAW 87-311 1961 federal legislation that allows the U.S. Export-lmport Bank to set up insurance protection  
for U.S. exporters against credit risk and political risk in order to help make U.S. exports more competitive and bolster  
the U.S. trade balance. The Foreign Credit Insurance Association oversees the insurance program, which is written by  
private insurers.  
PUBLIC LAW 91-156 1969 federal legislation requiring states to treat national banks, including those whose principal

responsible for cleanup of oil spills. Public Law 92-500 (the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972)  
extended responsibility to other hazardous substances.  
PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE very broad term for insurance covering liability exposures for individuals and  
business owners. It provides broad coverage, generally including all exposures for property damage and bodily injury,  
except exposures that relate to owner-ship of airplanes and automobiles, and to employees. Liability insurance may be  
written to cover specified hazards, as a COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE (CGL) policy,  
PACKAGE POLICY, or SCHEDULED POLICY.  
PUBLIC OFFICIAL BOND type of SURETY BOND that guarantees the performance of public officials. Public  
officials are responsible for a broad range of property including fees that they collect, money that they handle, and bank  
accounts that they oversee. They may also be held responsible for misdeeds that result in a loss of public funds by those  
they supervise. In some cases coverage is available for an entire group of employees under a PUBLIC EMPLOYEES  
BLANKET BOND.

PURCHASING POWER RISK investment risk associated with the relationship between the yield (interest, dividends,  
and capital) of financial instruments and the rate of inflation in the economy. For fixed income financial instruments  
such as a FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY and fixed dollar LIFE INSURANCE, the financial security of the recipient is  
diminished in proportion to the rise of inflation.  
PURE see PURE ANNUITY; PURE ENDOWMENT; PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD; PURE RISK.  
PURE AMOUNT OF PROTECTION see NET AMOUNT AT RISK.  
PURE ANNUITY contract sold by insurance companies that pays a monthly (quarterly, semiannual, or annual) income  
benefit for the life of a person (the ANNUITANT). The annuitant can never outlive the income from the annuity. Upon  
the death of the annuitant all income payments cease. There are no beneficiary benefits under this type of annuity.  
Contrast with REFUND ANNUITY.  
PURE ASSIGNMENT MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY see ASSESSABLE MUTUAL.  
PURE ENDOWMENT life insurance policy under which its face value is payable only if the insured survives to the end  
of the stated endowment period; no benefit is paid if the insured dies during the endowment period. Few if any of these  
policies are sold today. Contrast with ENDOWMENT INSURANCE.  
PURE LOSS COST RATIO see BURNING COST RATIO.  
PURE PREMIUM see PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD.  
PURE PREMIUM RATING METHOD approach that reflects losses expected. It is a calculation of the pure cost of  
property or liability insurance protection without loadings for the insurance company's expenses, premium taxes,  
contingencies, and profit margins. The pure premium is calculated according to the relationship:  
PURE RISK situation involving a chance of a loss or no loss, but no chance of gain. For example, either one's home  
burns or it does not; this risk is insurable. See also STANDARD RISK.  
PUT OPTION right to sell a given security at a stipulated price until a future expiration date. For example, assume the  
''None-Do-Well" company's stock has a market value of $20. Investor A sells Investor B an option (right) to buy  
Investor A's shares in the "None-Do-Well" company at a price of $25, good until 60 days hence. Investor B pays a  
premium of $4 per share for this right. If the stock's market value  
< previous page page_411 next page >  
 
< previous page page_412 next page >  
Page 412  
increases to a price greater than $29, Investor B will make a profit on the transaction. If, however, the stock falls below  
its original price of $20, Investor A will keep the stock as well as the $4 premium right per share it received from  
Investor B. If the 60-day limit expires without the right being executed, the option becomes void and worthless.  
PYRAMIDING situation in which several liability insurance policies are in force to cover the same risk, thereby  
resulting in higher limits of coverage than is required to adequately insure the risk.

Q 
Q SCHEDULE provision of the NEW YORK INSURANCE CODE and regulations under which (1) the life insurance  
company must file with the Insurance Commissioner all expenses associated with selling new life insurance policies;  
and (2) a limit is set on expenses to acquire new business.  
The expense limitation serves to restrict agent commissions in New York State. This is one important reason why many  
national insurance companies do not sell life insurance in New York, or why some organize subsidiary companies for  
the sole purpose of conducting life insurance business only in New York. Many life insurance companies feel the  
expense limitation too restrictive to attract brokerage business.  
QUADRUPLE INDEMNITY see ACCIDENTAL DEATH CLAUSE.  
QUALIFIED DOMESTIC TRUST type of TRUST established for the purpose of permitting the federal estate  
MARITAL DEDUCTION for ASSETS transferred from the decedent's estate to a surviving spouse who is not a citizen  
of the United States. The TRUSTEE for this trust must be a United States corporation or citizen, and if the assets are in  
excess of $2,000,000, the trustee must be a United States bank. Income from this trust can be distributed to the  
surviving spouse without incurring any estate tax consequences; however, any distributions of principal are subject to  
the federal estate tax. Upon the death of the surviving spouse and/or termination of the trust, the distributed principal of  
the trust is subject to federal estate tax.  
QUALIFIED IMPAIRMENT INSURANCE waiver of an impairment of an applicant for health insurance by attaching  
an ENDORSEMENT to the health insurance policy stating that the policy will pay no benefits in connection with the  
impairment. This waiver enables an applicant, who otherwise would not qualify, to be insured. See also

QUALIFIED PERSONAL RESIDENCE TRUST (QPRT) TRUST instrument that permits the owner of a residence  
(grantor) to transfer ownership of that residence with the grantor still being allowed to stay in that residence for a  
stipulated period of time on a tax advantage basis. The procedure in establishing such a trust would be for: (1) the  
grantor to establish an irrevocable trust that would allow the grantor to stay in that residence for a given period of time  
(for example 15, 20, or 30 years); and (2) the grantor to contribute the residence to the trust. At the end of that given  
time period, the residence will then be trans-  
< previous page page_413 next page >  
 
< previous page page_414 next page >  
Page 414  
ferred to the beneficiary(s) of the trust as selected by the grantor at the inception of the trust. The tax rules value the  
residence that transfers to the beneficiary(s) of the trust at a substantial discount from the actual value of the residence  
on the date the grantor contributed it to the trust. The disadvantages of the QPRT include the following: (1) at the end of  
the given period of time, the grantor can no longer stay in the residence and the beneficiary(s) own the residence  
outright; and (2) if the grantor dies before the expiration of the QPRT, the residence's actual value on the day it was  
contributed to the trust is included in the grantor's estate and thus becomes subject to FEDERAL ESTATE TAX. For  
example, a father retains, for a given time period, the right to use and possess the home. At the end of that time, the  
home's ownership reverts to the children but the father can continue to live in the home. If the father dies during the  
given time period, the home is taxed at full value as part of the father's estate. The life insurance policy previously  
purchased with the children as the beneficiary will override the lost estate tax savings because of the death of the father  
within that term period.  
QUALIFIED TERMINABLE INTEREST PROPERTY (Q TIP) TRUST strategy that provides that all income from  
assets in trust be paid at least annually for the life of the surviving spouse. This trust, which prohibits transfer of any  
assets to anyone else, can provide for the surviving spouse to will the property to one or more individuals among a  
group previously designated by the deceased spouse. For example, a husband establishes a Q TIP trust that gives his  
widow income for life. At the death of the wife, the corpus of the Q TIP trust will go the children, even though the  
corpus is part of the wife's estate. Since the husband elects how much of the estate is to be treated as Q TIP property, the  
estate tax strategy is to have only that portion of Q TIP property necessary to achieve zero estate death tax. See also

QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE automatic reinsurance that requires the insurer to transfer, and the reinsurer to  
accept, a given percentage of every risk within a defined category of business written by the insurer. For example, in the  
case of a 20% quota share, the insurer transfers 20% of its liability and premiums on every risk to the rein-surer, who  
must pay 20% of any loss sustained, whether total or partial. The percentage is constant throughout and applies to  
premiums and losses alike. See also REINSURANCE.

R 
RABBI TRUST TRUST named from a private-letter ruling by the IRS that involved a trust established by a Jewish  
congregation on behalf of its rabbi. The operation of the trust involves the employer's making contributions to the trust  
that are irrevocable. An independent trustee has control of the trust and must pay benefits from it if a stipulated event  
occurs, such as the death, disability, or retirement of the employee. If the employer becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the  
funds held in the trust are subject to the claims of the employer's creditors. The employer cannot take income tax  
deductions for its contributions to the trust until the funds in the trust are actually distributed to the employee.  
RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT OF 1970 (RICO) legislation that provides  
support for legal actions against individuals or organizations involved in systematic illegal activities. This act has been  
applied against insurance organizations when they were accused of bad-faith failure to pay claims or when there was a  
question of insolvency.  
RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION INSURANCE form of INLAND MARINE INSURANCE under which an  
insured is indemnified for damage or destruction of his or her on-premises property if it is due to radioactive material  
stored or used within the premises. See also MOTOR TRUCK CARGO RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION  
INSURANCE; SHIPPERS RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION INSURANCE.  
RADIO AND TELEVISION TRANSMITTING EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES, PIPELINES, TRAFFIC  
LIGHTS INSURANCE coverage if transmission equipment is damaged or destroyed on an ALL RISKS basis excluding  
the perils of war, wear and tear, inherent defect, and nuclear damage. CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS (indirect loss) may be  
added by endorsement to include such eventualities as lost revenue because of damage to a radio-transmitting line. This  
endorsement can be of special importance to businesses, such as stock brokerages, that transmit buy and sell orders.  
RADIUM FLOATER see RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION INSURANCE.  
RADIX base upon which a MORTALITY TABLE is built by beginning with a randomly selected group of people who  
are alive at the earliest age for which statistics are available on the number of people alive at that age. From this data,  
the rates of mortality can be used to build "the number of people alive at a given age" and "the number of people who  
die at a given age" columns in the mortality table.

death, retirement, disability, and unemployment. Benefits are adjusted for cost of living increases according to the  
formula used for Social Security.  
RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK INSURANCE coverage for railroad equipment, liability of a railroad for damaging  
another railroad's equipment, or the damage to goods under its care, custody, and control. Coverage is provided on an  
ALL RISKS basis subject to perils specifically excluded in the policy.  
RAILROAD SIDETRACK AGREEMENT see SIDETRACK AGREEMENT.  
RAILROAD TRAVEL POLICY see TRAVEL ACCIDENT INSURANCE.  
RAIN INSURANCE business interruption insurance in which the insured is indemnified for loss of earnings and  
payment of expenses resulting from adverse weather conditions. For example, the raining out of a fair, horse race, or  
boxing match can cause a substantial loss of money for a promoter who may have spent huge sums in advance of the  
event for rental, advertising, and site conditioning. However, the policy does not cover damage to property because of  
rain.  
RANCHOWNERS INSURANCE see FARMOWNERS AND RANCHOWNERS INSURANCE.  
RANDOM INSURANCE coverage up to specific limits for payments demanded by kidnappers for the release of an  
insured held against his or her will. Most random insurance policies have a deductible and exclude abductions within  
certain geographical areas from coverage.  
RANDOM SAMPLE sample of n elements selected from a population of N elements in such a way that the sample has  
essentially the same characteristics as the population. The random sample serves as the foundation of all  
PROBABILITY theory as it relates to probability in sampling. In theory, all subsets drawn from the same sample have  
an equal chance of being drawn. Sampling is extremely important to the calculation of premium rates. For example, if  
the INSURER wants to predict the probability that a wood-frame house will burn, the sample must be drawn from the  
population of wood-frame houses, not brick-frame houses.

unique impairment, occupation, or hobby, such as a history of heart disease or a circus performer or sky diver.  
RATED UP see RATED POLICY.  
RATE FACTORS see RATE MAKING.  
RATE MAKING process of calculating a PREMIUM so that it is (1) adequatesufficient to pay losses according to  
expected FREQUENCY and severity, thereby safeguarding against the insurance company becoming insolvent; (2)  
reasonablethe insurance company should not be able to earn an excessive profit; and (3) not unfairly discriminatory or  
inequitable. Theoretically, it can be said that each insurance applicant should pay a unique premium to reflect a  
different expectation of loss, but this would be impractical. Instead, classifications are established for applicants to be  
grouped according to similar expectation of loss. Statistical studies of a large number of nearly homogeneous exposures  
in each underwriting classification enable the projection of losses after adjustments for future inflation and statistical  
irregularities. The adjusted statistics are used to calculate the pure cost of protection, or pure premium, to which the  
insurance company adds on loads for agent commissions, premium taxes, administrative expenses, contingency  
reserves, other acquisition costs, and profit margin. The result is the GROSS PREMIUM to be charged to the insured.  
RATE MANUAL publication that lists premiums charged for products sold by an insurance company. A manual also  
has underwriting guidelines for agents. A life insurance rate manual includes minimum guaranteed NONFORFEITURE  
values; and if a participating policy, dividend scales.  
RATE OF RETURN METHOD OF COST COMPARISON approach advocated by the Federal Trade Commission  
(FTC) in its 1979 LIFE INSURANCE COST disclosure report. It calculates the rate of return earned by the savings  
element of a life insurance policy in these steps:  
1. determine pure cost of protection (mortality expectation).  
2. determine amount of dividends paid (if it is a participating policy).  
3. subtract the pure cost of protection plus dividends from the GROSS PREMIUMS paid into the policy. This is the  
savings element.  
4. the rate of return equals the interest rate at which the savings element must be accumulated in order to equal the cash  
value of the policy at some future specified time period. See also INTEREST ADJUSTED COST.  
RATE OF SURPLUS FORMATION RATIO insurance company's growth rate of ADJUSTED SURPLUS divided by  
its ADJUSTED LIABILITIES. The greater this ratio, the more financially sound the insurance company, as the surplus  
would be increasing at a faster rate than the liabilities.

RATING a valuation of risk of an individual or organization.  
RATING BUREAU cooperative organization among insurers that rates and prepares new policy forms according to  
guidelines and regulations of the state INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. Loss experience, collected according to the line  
of business in specific geographical areas, is used to suggest rates for use by the rating bureau member companies. They  
may either use these rates or file their own deviated rates for approval by the state insurance department if it is a prior  
approval state. In an open competition state, a company does not need approval for a deviated rate. In a file-and-use  
state, a company can use a deviated rate without approval, after having filed it with the state insurance department. In a  
modified prior approval state, a company can use a deviated rate after filing it with the state insurance department  
provided it is a modest deviation and not a new rate classification.

REAL ESTATE SWAP transaction in which the property owner (for example, a pension fund) agrees to pay the  
insurance company a rate of return tied to the fluctuations in real estate prices. In return, the insurance company  
stipulates that it will pay the property owner a rate of return that is more predictable, such as a floating interest rate, if  
the insurance company believes that the depressed real estate market has an attractive potential for capital gains but has  
no desire to own and/or manage property. Meanwhile a pension fund owns more property than  
< previous page page_419 next page >  
 
< previous page page_420 next page >  
Page 420  
it deems prudent. The solution, through the swap, would entail the pension fund passing on to the insurance company  
any gains or losses generated by the property in return for the insurance company paying the pension fund a floating  
interest rate. This floating interest rate to be paid would be tied to a stipulated index such as the U.S. Treasury Bill rate.  
The result would be that the pension fund lowers its real estate portfolio to a more acceptable level, and the insurance  
company has increasing capital gains expectations.

exchange to include paying losses experienced by the exchange, investing premium inflow into the exchange, recruiting  
new members, underwriting the inflow of new business, under-writing renewal business, receiving premiums, and  
exchanging reinsurance contracts. Members share profits and losses in the same proportion as the amount of insurance

REDETERMINATION PROVISION PROVISION found in CURRENT ASSUMPTION WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE  
policies under which the insurance company retains the contractual right to recalculate the premium (after a minimum  
period of time that the policy has been in force). However, the company guarantees that, at the least, a minimum interest  
rate will be credited to the cash value and, at the most, a maximum mortality charge will be subtracted. The resultant  
new premium may be greater than or less than the original premium. If the new premium is greater than the original  
premium, the POLICYOWNER may pay this greater premium, thereby retaining the original death benefit under the  
policy, or the policyowner may still pay the original premium, but the new death benefit will be lower than it was  
originally. On the other hand, if the new premium is less than the original premium, the policyowner may pay this lesser  
premium, thereby retaining the original death benefit under the policy, or the policyowner may still pay the original  
premium with the death benefit becoming greater than it was originally, or the difference in the new premium and the  
original premium can be added to the policy's cash value.

coverage, it will be corrected to the intended $100,000 amount.  
REFUND ANNUITY form of annuity returning premiums plus interest to a beneficiary if the annuitant dies during the  
accumulation period. A refund annuity costs more than a pure annuity. If the annuitant dies during the liquidation  
period, benefits paid to any beneficiary depend on whether the refund annuity is in the form of a LIFE ANNUITY  
CERTAIN, INSTALLMENT REFUND ANNUITY, or CASH REFUND ANNUITY.

REHABILITATION BENEFIT sum provided by a DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE that pays a multiple of the  
MONTHLY INDEMNITY to cover the costs associated with a retraining course attended by the insured wage earner  
when the wage earner's income is interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or accident. This retraining  
course is designed to enable the disabled worker to be retrained to perform another economic function.  
REHABILITATION CLAUSE provision in health insurance under which an insured disabled person is required to  
undertake (and is reimbursed for) expenses associated with vocational rehabilitation for retraining to perform another  
economic function.  
REIMBURSE BENEFITS payment by the insurance company to the insured for the actual expenses incurred by the

AGREEMENTS under which an income payment or a series of income payments is paid to the buyer of the disabled  
partner's interest contained in a PARTNERSHIP LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN or disabled stockholder's  
interest contained in a CLOSE CORPORATION PLAN to reimburse that buyer for the sum paid. If this sum to be paid  
the buyer by the insurance company exceeds the actual market value of the business at the time of the sale, that sum is  
reduced to the actual market value.  
REIMBURSEMENT OF INSURED payment of benefits by an insurance policy to a POLICYOWNER (usually the  
insured) if a loss occurs.  
REINSTATEMENT restoration of a policy that has lapsed because of nonpayment of premiums after the grace period  
has expired. In life insurance the reinstatement time period is three years from the premium due date. The company  
usually requires the insured to show evidence of continued insurability (for example, by taking a medical examination);  
to pay all past premiums plus interest due; and to either reinstate or repay any loans that are still outstanding. Because  
the insured is now older and a new policy would require a higher premium, it may be to the advantage of an insured to  
reinstate a policy.

REINSURANCE) by giving (ceding) a portion of its liability to another insurance company (the reinsurer).  
Reinsurance enables an insurance company to (1) expand its capacity; (2) stabilize its underwriting results; (3) finance  
its expanding volume; (4) secure catastrophe protection against shock losses; (5) withdraw from a class or line of  
business, or a geographical area, within a relatively short time period; and (6) share large risks with other companies.

life of a given number of tenants. A partial donation of the property may be made; the property does not have to be  
donated as a whole unit.  
REMOVAL insured peril in some property insurance policies that encompasses any accidental damage to insured  
property while being removed to safety from the immediate threat of damage by another peril covered by that policy.  
For example, if an insured removes a chair from a burning home, puts it on the lawn, and then rain damages the chair,  
the loss insured would be covered by fire insurance on the furnishings of the home.  
REMOVAL BOND see JUDICIAL BOND.  
RENEWABLE TERM HEALTH INSURANCE see COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE.  
RENEWABLE TERM LIFE INSURANCE coverage that is renewable at the option of the insured, who is not required  
to take a medical examination. Regardless of physical condition, the insured must be allowed to renew the policy and  
the premium cannot be increased to reflect any adverse physical condition. However, the premium of each renewal  
increases to reflect the LIFE EXPECTANCY of the individual at that particular age.  
RENEWAL automatic reestablishment of an insurance policy's in-force status, usually achieved through payment of the  
premium due. See also COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE RENEWAL CERTIFICATE; RENEWAL

or 100%. The higher the coinsurance amount, the lower the premium.  
REPARATIONS payment made by a party causing harm to the party incurring that harm.  
REPLACEMENT CAR automobile purchased or leased by the insured or the insured's spouse that takes the place of the  
insured or the insured spouse's present car as covered in the PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP). It will have

REPLACEMENT COST LESS PHYSICAL DEPRECIATION AND OBSOLESCENCE sum it takes to replace an  
insured's damaged or destroyed property with one of like kind and quality, equivalent to the actual cash value, minus  
physical depreciation (fair wear and tear) and obsolescence. The objective is to place the insured in the same financial  
position after a loss as prior to it; the insured should not profit or lose by incurring a loss.  
REPLACEMENT, LIFE INSURANCE exchange of a new policy for one already in force. See also CONSERVATION.  
REPLACEMENT RATIO measure showing how much life insurance an agent has lost through replacement. It is  
expressed as a percentage of number of policies, face amount, or premium volume.  
REPLACEMENT, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REPRODUCTION COST option to an insurance company to replace,

Treasury Department the names of employees who terminated employment with vested benefits, and the amount of the  
benefits. The Treasury sends the Social Security Administration a copy, which is available to an employee on request. A  
statement on vested benefits is given by the Social Security Administration to an applicant for Social Security benefits.  
REPRESENTATIONS statements by an insurance applicant concerning personal health history, family health history,

to the relative sizes of the REPLACEMENT, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REPRODUCTION COST.  
REQUIRED INSURANCE see COMPULSORY INSURANCE.  
REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION (RMD) requirement that an individual must withdraw a minimum sum  
annually from retirement savings that have accumulated on a tax-deferred basis. This withdrawal must begin by April 1  
of the year one reaches age 70 1/2. All deferred tax retirement savings plans (with the exception of the ROTH IRA) are  
subject to this rule to include the traditional INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA), SIMPLIFIED  
EMPLOYEE PENSION (SEP), SAVINGS INCENTIVE MATCH PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES (SIMPLE PLANS),  
SECTION 401 (K) PLAN (SALARY REDUCTION PLAN), SECTION 403 (B) PLAN, QUALIFIED PENSION  
PLAN, AND PROFIT-SHARING PLAN. Withdrawals may be made based on the individual's LIFE EXPECTANCY or  
the joint life expectancy of the individual and the individual's oldest PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. The steps for  
calculating the RMD are  
1. determining the total market value of the retirement plan as of December 31 of the year prior to the retirement year.  
2. determining the life expectancy factor according to the Internal Revenue Service tables.  
3. dividing the value of the retirement plan by the life expectancy factor.  
REQUIREMENTS see REQUIREMENTS OF INSURABLE RISK.  
REQUIREMENTS OF INSURABLE RISK  
1. a large number of homogeneous exposures (in order for the deviation of actual losses from expected losses to  
approach zero, and the creditability of the prediction to approach one).  
2. loss must be definite in time and amount.  
3. loss must be fortuitous. An insured cannot cause the loss to happen; it must be due to chance.  
4. must not be an exposure to catastrophic loss; risks must be spread over a large geographical area to prevent their  
concentration. REINSURANCE often is used to spread potentially catastrophic risks.  
5. premium must be reasonable in relation to the potential loss. In theory, one could even insure against a pencil point  
breaking, but the premium would be much greater than any possible loss.

RESIDUAL DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE coverage for an individual with a residual disability. Benefits are  
usually payable for the unused portion of the total disability benefit period up to age 65. If an individual is at least age  
55 at the time of disablement, and total disability lasts less than a year, residual benefits are payable for the unused  
portion of the benefit period for up to 18 months, but not beyond age 65. If there is at least a 25% loss in current  
earnings, the residual benefits will equal the percentage of loss times the monthly benefit for total disability. The  
residual disability monthly benefit can be expressed in this equation:

RES IPSA LOQUITOR Latin phrase for "The facts speak for themselves." This is a rule of evidence under which an  
individual is deemed, under certain specific circumstances, to be negligent by the mere occurrence of an accident. These  
circumstances are defined as when the law presumes that an accident could not have occurred had the individual not  
been negligent.  
RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR Latin for "Let the superior reply." That is, an employer is liable for the torts of employees  
that result from their employment. For example, an insurance company (the master) acts through its agent (servant);  
because of this master-servant relationship, any wrongs the agent commits are deemed to have been committed by the  
insurance company, which must accept responsibility.  
REST CURE care in a sanitarium, nursing home, or other facility designed to provide CUSTODIAL CARE on behalf of  
the mental and physical well-being of the patient. The cost may or may not be provided by health insurance policies.  
RESTORATION OF PLAN authority of the PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC) to stop the  
termination of a pension plan and restore it to its previous status by returning a portion or all of the plan's assets and  
liabilities. For example, such an action could be taken by the PBGC when a company whose pension plan is being  
< previous page page_432 next page >

Page 433  
terminated has experienced a reversal in the adverse conditions that originally caused the termination.  
RESTORATION OF VESTED BENEFITS plan under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT  
OF 1974 (ERISA) for employees who are less than 50% vested. An employee must be permitted to buy back retirement  
benefits lost because of the withdrawal of his or her contributions. The employee pays back to the pension plan the  
withdrawal contributions, plus 5% interest compounded annually.  
RESTORATION PREMIUM sum that an insurance company charges a business firm to restore a property or liability  
insurance policy, or a bond, to its initial face value after the insurance company has paid a claim either to the insured  
business or to a third party on behalf of the insured business.  
RESUMPTION OF OPERATIONS CLAUSE in a BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE policy, clause that  
stipulates that if, by resuming operations, the business can reduce a loss, the business is obligated to so do. If the  
business refuses to resume operations, it will incur a portion of the loss.  
RETAIL CREDIT REPORT report developed by or supplied by a credit agency to an insurer dealing with the financial  
standing and character of an insurance applicant. These factors are carefully weighted by the company's underwriter in  
deciding the INSURABILITY of the applicant. See also NUMERICAL RATING SYSTEM.  
RETAINED ASSET SERVICES (RAS) insurance company program in which the beneficiary of an insurance policy is  
encouraged to leave the death proceeds in an account on deposit with the insurance company instead of receiving a  
LUMP SUM payment. If the beneficiary elects to participate in the RAS, a bank account is established in the  
beneficiary's name and the beneficiary will receive a personalized checkbook. The RAS provides the insurer with a  
vehicle to retain assets to invest as well as a means to cross-sell additional insurance products to the beneficiary.  
RETAINED EARNINGS net profit of a business, less dividends. Reinvestment of retained earnings enables an  
insurance company to write more business from a stronger capital base. Contributions to retained earnings come from  
three sources: (1) excess interest from investment earnings; (2) loss savings (fewer and/or smaller losses than were  
loaded into premiums); and (3) expense savings (less expense costs than were loaded into premiums). See also  
SURPLUS ACCOUNT.  
RETAINER CLAUSE provision in a nonproportional reinsurance contract that the reinsurance will protect only the  
business retained by the cedent for its own account. In this connection, losses must be assumed by the cedent if it cannot  
enforce payment for any loss falling under its other surplus or QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE contract.

RETALIATION LAWS legislation by a state that taxes out-of-state insurance companies operating in its jurisdiction in  
the same way that the state's own insurance companies are taxed in the second state. For example, state #1 charges a tax  
of 4% on its domiciled insurers. But if these insured are charged a higher tax when operating in state #2, then state #1  
will charge the higher tax to insurers of state #2 who wish to do business in state #1.

which payment is made by a reinsurer of each and every loss incurred by the cedent in excess of a specified sum, up to a  
fixed limit. Under this clause, there is no restriction on the number of claims that may be recovered by the cedent under  
the contract for any one event. The only stipulation is that each claim must arise as a result of the event in question.  
RETENTION DEDUCTIBLE in UMBRELLA LIABILITY INSURANCE clause that stipulates that in the event of a  
loss where there are no underlying policies providing coverage, the DEDUCTIBLE will apply.  
RETENTION OF LOSS see RETENTION AND LIMITS CLAUSE; RISK MANAGEMENT; SELF INSURANCE.  
RETIRED LIVES RESERVE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN whose objective is to provide the retired  
employee with life insurance. This group life insurance product is composed of two basic parts: (1) annually  
RENEWABLE TERM LIFE INSURANCE until age 100; and (2) accumulation of a reserve element while the  
employee is working from which premium payments will be made on the annually renewable term life insurance after  
the employee retires. Premium payments that the employer makes on behalf of the employee are a tax-deductible  
expense, not considered taxable income to the employee by the Internal Revenue Service. Should the employee  
terminate service prior to retirement, regardless of the reason, funds remaining in the employee's account are used to  
fund the benefits of the remaining employees.  
RETIREMENT AGE age at which a pension plan participant is entitled to receive retirement benefits, or point at which  
retirement benefits are payable: (1) NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE is the earliest age permitted to retire and receive  
full benefits; (2) EARLY RETIREMENT is earlier-than-normal age permitted to retire provided attained minimum age  
and service requirement are met, but there is a proportionate reduction in benefits; (3) DEFERRED RETIREMENT age  
beyond automatic retirement age permitted to retire, usually with no increase in benefits; (4) automatic retirement age is  
age at which retirement is automatically effective.

RETIREMENT INCOME PAYMENTS see RETIREMENT BENEFITS.  
RETIREMENT INCOME POLICY form of DEFERRED ANNUITY; a life insurance policy that usually guarantees  
from 120 to 180 monthly income payments to the annuitant at retirement. If the annuitant dies during the deferral (or  
guaranteed) period, a beneficiary receives a death payment of the face amount or the cash value, whichever is larger.  
During the deferred period, the policyowner can withdraw part or all of the annuity's cash value (the latter terminating  
the annuity). See also ANNUITY.

RETIREMENT PLAN OPTIONS choice among the following options made by retiree prior to retirement concerning  
the distribution of benefits:  
1. Monthly payments for lifetime of retiree with no SURVIVORSHIP BENEFITincome payments are the largest to the  
retiree under this  
< previous page page_435 next page >  
 
< previous page page_436 next page >  
Page 436  
option since all income payments cease upon the death of the retiree.  
2. Monthly payments for lifetime of retiree with 100% survivorship benefitincome payments are paid during the time  
the retiree is alive and continue at the 100 percent level to a beneficiary after the death of the retiree. There is a  
significant reduction in the dollar amount of each monthly income payment to the retiree because beneficiary's number  
of payments are likely to continue for a long time.  
3. Monthly payments for lifetime of retiree subject to a minimum number guaranteed to be paidincome payments are  
paid during the time the retiree is alive. Should the retiree die before receiving a minimum number of income payments,  
payments are made to a beneficiary until the minimum number has been paid, at which time all payments cease. The  
longer the minimum number of payments guaranteed, the greater the reduction in the dollar amounts of each monthly  
income payment to the retiree.  
4. Monthly payments for lifetime of retiree with 50% survivorship benefitincome payments paid during the time the  
retiree is alive and continue at the 50% level to a beneficiary after the death of the retiree. There is a reduction in the  
dollar amount of each monthly income payment to the retiree because beneficiary's number of payments are likely to  
continue for a long time.  
5. Monthly payments for a guaranteed number of yearsincome payments are made for a stipulated number of years  
(period certain), not for the life of the retiree. The stipulated number of years is usually 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, or 20  
years. Should the retiree die before receiving income payments for the stipulated time period, the beneficiary would  
receive income payments until the time period expires.  
6. Lump sum (cash refund)accumulation in retiree's account distributed in one sum.  
Once income payments commence under any of the above options, the retiree cannot change the option. The retiree  
cannot exclude the spouse from the survivorship benefit unless the spouse waives his or her right in writing.  
RETIREMENT RATE ASSUMPTIONS see PENSION PLAN FUNDING INSTRUMENTS.  
RETIREMENT TEST requirement that a retired worker can have annual earnings of no more than a stipulated amount  
in order to receive a full retirement income under Social Security if under age 70. There is a reduction of $1 of every $3  
earned in excess of that amount. Once the retired worker reaches age 70, that worker can earn any amount without a  
corresponding decrease in Social Security income.

RETROACTIVE RESTORATION REINSTATEMENT of an INSURANCE POLICY or BOND to its original FACE  
AMOUNT (FACE OF POLICY) after the payment by the INSURER of a loss. The purpose of this type of coverage is  
to INDEMNIFY the INSURED if, at a time period in the future, previous losses incurred by the insured are discovered.  
RETROCESSIONAIRE REINSURER of a reinsurer. See also RETROCESSION.  
RETROCESSION REINSURANCE of a reinsurer. See also RETROCESSION CATASTROPHE COVER.  
RETROCESSION CATASTROPHE COVER REINSURANCE of a rein-surer such that the reinsurer protects itself  
from a catastrophe occurrence. Just as an insurer must decide to CEDE to the reinsurer a portion of a risk it has  
underwritten, the reinsurer must make the same decision as to which risks it can sustain within its resources, and what  
portion of the risks it must retrocede. Retrocession may be either proportional or nonproportional. See also  
NONPROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE; PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE.  
RETRO-NOTE PLAN means of financing by which some large organizations pay their property or liability insurance  
premiums to reflect losses actually paid during the first year of coverage, plus claims expenses, administrative and  
servicing expenses, and a loading for the company's profit. The insured signs a promissory note to the company for the  
difference in the normal or standard premium that should have been charged.  
RETROSPECTIVE AGGREGATE EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE type of EXCESS OF LOSS  
REINSURANCE in which the insurance company (cedent) cedes its risk of loss on INCURRED BUT NOT  
REPORTED LOSSES (IBNR) and previously reported losses.  
RETROSPECTIVE COMPUTATION see RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUM.  
RETROSPECTIVE METHOD RESERVE COMPUTATION accumulated value of assumed past net life insurance  
premiums, minus the accumulated value of past benefits (claims paid).

RETROSPECTIVE RATING method of establishing rates in which the current year's premium is calculated to reflect  
the actual current year's loss experience. An initial premium is charged and then adjusted at the end of the policy year to  
reflect the actual loss experience of the business.  
RETURN COMMISSION return of a pro rata portion of an agent's commission for a policy that is canceled prior to its  
expiration date. A commission is paid to an agent in the expectation that the premium will be earned over the life of a  
policy. If the policy is canceled, a portion of the unearned premium (either pro rata or short rate) also must be returned  
to the policyowner.  
RETURN OF CASH VALUE CLAUSE provision in a life insurance policy that if an insured dies within a given period  
of time, the beneficiary receives the face value of the policy plus its cash value. See also CASH SURRENDER VALUE.  
RETURN OF PREMIUM see CANCELLATION PROVISION CLAUSE.  
RETURN ON ASSETS (ROA) net income expressed as a percentage of average total assets. This percentage measures  
profitability by expressing the efficiency of asset utilization.  
RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) net income expressed as a percentage of average total equity. This percentage measures  
profitability by expressing how efficiently invested capital or equity is being utilized.  
RETURN ON EQUITY RATIO insurance company's NET GAIN FROM OPERATIONS divided by its ADJUSTED  
SURPLUS. This is the accounting rate of return on stockholder's equity since the ratio shows the rate of return the  
company is earning on its capital and surplus committed to conducting its insurance business and investments made.  
The greater this ratio, the greater the use the company is making of the funds invested in it by its stockholders.  
RETURN ON NET WORTH (RONW) ratio of net income after taxes to total end of the year NET WORTH. This ratio  
indicates the return on stockholder's total equity.  
RETURN PREMIUM amount received by the POLICYHOLDER if the policy is canceled, benefits are reduced, or the  
PREMIUM is reduced. See also PRO RATA CANCELLATION; SHORT RATE CANCELLATION.  
REVENUE BULLETIN 1988-52 ruling issued in 1988 by the Internal Revenue Service that stipulates that, when  
computing the pension benefits of an employee still working after 1987, the years of service on the job after the  
employee reaches age 65 cannot be disregarded. The issuance of this revenue bulletin makes it mandatory that pension  
benefits reflect all years on the job, to include those years after age 65.

REVENUE RULING 59-60 ruling that is the most significant source for the valuation of closely held corporation  
capital stock critical to the CLOSE CORPORATION PLAN. This ruling defines the fair market value as ''the price at  
which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any  
compulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, both parties having reasonable knowledge of the  
relevant facts." The valuation of the shares of closely held corporations involves the comparison of "prices at which the  
stocks of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business are selling in a free and open market." This ruling  
stipulates that the following factors must be carefully considered in such an evaluation: (1) intangible values such as  
goodwill; (2) financial ability to generate an ongoing dividend stream; (3) earnings capability; (4) type of business and  
its financial and market history; (5) economic outlook for the industry in which the business resides; (6) financial  
condition of the corporation as well as the book value of its stock; (7) size of the block of stock requiring a valuation;  
and (8) market value of stocks actively traded on an exchange or over-the-counter market of similar corporations  
engaged in similar lines of business.  
REVERSE-ANNUITY MORTGAGE (RAM) loan under which the owner of a home receives the equity in the form of  
a series of monthly income payments for life. Upon the owner's death, the lender institution (usually a bank) gains title  
to the home and is free to keep or sell it. The longer that monthly income payments are made, the greater the reduction  
in the owner's equity in his or her home. This type of mortgage is of value to older individuals who own their homes  
free and clear. Their large equity enables them to continue to live there and to receive a monthly income benefit.  
REVERSE SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE policy that is the opposite of the traditional SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE  
INSURANCE policy in that: (1) the employee is the POLICYOWNER and as such can exercise all ownership rights  
inherit to that policy; (2) the employee owns the CASH VALUE of the policy; (3) the employees's beneficiary has the  
right to that portion of the death benefit equal to the cash value; (4) the employer retains the right to that portion of the  
death benefit equal to the pure protection element (death benefit minus the cash value); (5) the employer pays that  
portion of the premium charged for its economic benefit gained according to the PS 58 RATE TABLE; and (6) the  
employee pays that portion of the premium equal to the total premium minus that part of the premium paid by the  
employer in the above.

REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST TRUST in which rights to make any changes therein are retained by the GRANTOR.  
At the grantor's death all rights become irrevocable. This type of trust has several advantages: it can avoid PROBATE,  
it prevents public disclosure of the assets of the trust, it can easily be revised or terminated, and it promotes continuity  
for the transfer of the estate. However, since the grantor retains ownership rights under this trust, the trust loses all of  
the income and estate tax advantages available under an IRREVOCABLE LIVING TRUST.  
RIDER endorsement to an insurance policy that modifies clauses and provisions of the policy, including or excluding  
coverage.  
RIDERS, LIFE POLICIES endorsements to life insurance policies that provide additional benefits or limit an insurance  
company's liability for payment of benefits under certain conditions. These include:  
1. Waiver of Premium for Disability. An insured with total disability that lasts for a specified period no longer has to  
pay premiums for the duration of the disability. In effect, the company pays the premiums.  
2. Accidental Death Benefit.  
3. GUARANTEED INSURABILITY.  
4. COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT (COLA).  
5. Other Insured. Term life insurance is added on a person other than the primary insured, with the rate based on the  
other person's age, sex, underwriting classification, and amount of coverage.  
6. Children's Insurance. Term insurance on each child is added, usually to the age of majority. Generally, a child cannot  
become insured before the age of 15 days or after his or her eighteenth birthday.  
7. Additional Insurance. Term insurance can be added to ordinary life policies as an additional layer of coverage for  
some specified time interval.  
8. Transfer of Insureds. In business situations, generally used to insure key persons with the cash value and the  
insurance coverage transferable from the initial insured person to another person.

RIOT AND CIVIL COMMOTION INSURANCE coverage for damage to property resulting from riot or civil  
commotion. Riot is defined by most state laws as a violent disturbance involving three or more (in some states two or  
more) persons. Civil commotion is a more serious and prolonged disturbance or violent uprising. Losses from riots in  
major cities during the 1960s caused insurers to stop writing this type of coverage in certain urban areas. In response,  
Congress enacted

organizations, public organizations, and service organizations. Both profit and nonprofit organizations are represented.  
The goal of RIMS is to upgrade the management of risk and employee benefit plans in order to preserve the assets of  
the organization in question. Included in the activities of RIMS are research, conferences and seminars, and sponsorship  
of the INSURANCE INSTITUTE OF AMERICAS (IIA) ASSOCIATE IN RISK MANAGEMENT (ARM) program.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL amount of required capital that the insurance company must maintain based on the inherent  
risks in the insurer's operations. These risks include ASSET DEPRECIATION RISK, CREDIT RECEIVABLES RISK,  
UNDERWRITING RISK, and OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK.  
RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO measurement of the amount of capital (assets minus liabilities) an insurance company  
has as a basis of support for the degree of risk associated with its company operations and investments. This ratio  
identifies the companies that are inadequately capitalized by dividing the company's capital by the minimum amount of  
capital that the regulatory authorities feel is necessary to support the insurance operations. A ratio of 1.00 or greater is  
deemed to be satisfactory. This standard can be used to identify inadequately  
< previous page page_441 next page >  
 
< previous page page_442 next page >  
Page 442  
capitalized life and health companies, thereby enabling regulatory authorities to intervene before a company becomes  
insolvent.  
RISK-BASED CAPITAL STATISTIC (RBCS) ratio of AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL RISK-BASED CAPITAL  
of an insurance company to its TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL. This statistic determines regulatory action taken by the  
state's insurance commissioner. If the RBCS is greater than 200%, no regulatory action is required. If the RBCS is  
between 150 and 200%, the insurer must file a plan of corrective action with the insurance commissioner as well as  
provide an explanation of why the RBCS standards were not met. If the RBCS is between 100 and 150%, the insurer  
must file a plan of corrective action with the insurance commission and the insurance commissioner will examine the  
insurer. If the RBCS is between 70 and 150%, the insurance commissioner may seize the insurer. If the RBCS is below  
70%, the insurance commissioner is required to liquidate or rehabilitate the insurer.

RISK PHILOSOPHY personal view regarding how losses occur and the validity of loss prevention and reduction; also,  
whether an individual is a risk taker or a risk avoider. For example, if a driver takes the view that dying in a serious  
automobile accident is inevitable, then use of seat belts is unnecessary. On the other hand, a driver's philosophy may be  
that wearing a seat belt will minimize injury and reduce the chance of dying in an accident.

RISK RETENTION see SELF INSURANCE.  
RISK RETENTION ACT OF 1986 federal act composed of amendments to the Product Liability Risk Retention Act of  
1981 and enacted to make the procedures more efficient for creating RISK RETENTION GROUPS (capitalized,  
member-owned INSURANCE COMPANY) and PURCHASING GROUPS (INSURANCE buyers group formed to  
obtain coverage for homogeneous LIABILITY RISKS, in many instances hard to insure, from an insurance company).  
RISK RETENTION GROUP see SELF INSURANCE.  
RISK SELECTION methods by which a home office underwriter chooses applicants that an insurer will accept. The  
underwriter's job is  
< previous page page_443 next page >  
 
< previous page page_444 next page >  
Page 444  
to spread the costs equitably among members of the group to be insured. Therefore, the underwriter must determine  
which are normal risks, or standard risks, to be charged the standard rate; which are sub-standard risks, to be charged a  
higher rate; and which are preferred risks, to receive a discount. This process is made more difficult by SELFSELECTION  
and ADVERSE SELECTION. The underwriter must screen applicants who are looking for insurance,  
specifically because they have a greater-than-normal chance of loss, and set the correct PREMIUM rate for them.

is covered on a personal basis through the purchase of a HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY or renters insurance  
or on a business basis through a SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP) policy. Specialty items such as coin  
and stamp collections must be specifically scheduled on a property policy in order for the insured to receive full value  
for a loss.

ROLLOUT method of terminating a SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE policy by the company transferring its  
interest in the policy (after the company has effected the largest POLICY LOAN permitted equal to the cash value) to  
the insured employee. The insured employee, by accepting this transfer, incurs the obligation to continue to service the  
interest on the policy loan made by the company.  
ROLLOVER payment of an employee's EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN benefits to the employee's  
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) or to another plan maintained by the employer.  
ROLLOVER AND WITHHOLDING RULES FOR QUALIFIED PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS rules stating that every  
administrator of a QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, PROFIT SHARING PLAN, SECTION 401(K) PLAN (SALARY  
REDUCTION PLAN), SECTION 403(B) PLAN, and stock bonus plan must provide the employee the option to  
directly roll over all or part of that employee's distribution to an INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) or to  
another qualified plan. Any part of the distribution that has  
< previous page page_444 next page >  
 
< previous page page_445 next page >  
Page 445  
not been directly transferred to another qualified plan is subject to a mandatory 20% withholding subject to federal  
income taxes. Employees have 60 days within which to directly transfer their distribution to another qualified plan. The  
only distributions that may not be rolled over are the following: (1) periodic payments that continue for at least ten  
years; (2) minimum required distribution amounts paid to employees who are at least age 70 1/2; and (3) periodic  
payments made at least annually and based upon the life or joint lives of the employee and the employee's designated  
beneficiary.  
ROLLOVER AND WITHHOLDING RULES FOR QUALIFIED PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS: PAYMENT PAID TO  
EMPLOYEE rules stating that, for any portion of the payment made to the employee from an ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER  
DISTRIBUTION, the plan administrator is required by federal law to withhold 20% of the distribution. The amount  
withheld is sent to the IRS as income tax withholding to be credited against the employee's tax obligations. If the  
employee is paid an eligible rollover distribution, the distribution can still be rolled over (in total or in part) into an  
eligible employer plan or an IRA, provided the rollover is accomplished within 60 days of the time the employee  
receives the payment. That portion of the distribution that is rolled over will not be subject to taxes until the employee  
withdraws it from the eligible employer plan or from the IRA. If the employer should receive a distribution before  
reaching age 59 1/2 and does not roll it over, it will be taxed as ordinary income in the year received, plus an extra tax  
of 10% of the taxable portion of the distribution must be paid. This extra 10% penalty does not apply to the distribution  
under the following circumstances: (1) the employee separates from service with the employer during or after the year  
the employee attains age 55; (2) distribution is paid to the employee in equal payment over the life expectancy of the  
employee and/or that of the employee's beneficiary; and (3) distribution is paid due to the retirement on disability of the  
employee.  
If the employee receives a lump sum distribution (payment within one year of the employee's total funds on deposit  
under the EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN because the employee has attained age 59 1/2, or has separated  
from the employer's service; or if self-employed, has reached age 59 1/2 or has become disabled) after having  
participated in the plan for at least five years, the distribution is subject to special tax treatment as follows: (1) Five-  
Year Averaging; (2) Ten-Year Averaging if the employee was born before January 1, 1936; and (3) long-term capital  
gain treatment at a rate of 20 percent if the employee was born before January 1, 1936. If the employee desires to roll  
over 100% of the eligible rollover distribution to an employee benefit insurance plan or IRA, including the 20%  
withheld for income tax purposes, other funds must be contributed within the 60-day period to replace the 20% withheld  
(if only 80% of the distribution received is rolled over, the employee must pay ordinary income taxes on the 20%  
withheld).

ROLLOVER AND WITHHOLDING RULES FOR QUALIFIED PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS: PAYMENT PAID TO  
SURVIVING SPOUSES AND OTHER BENEFICIARIES rules that apply to employee distributions (see ROLLOVER  
AND WITHHOLDING RULES FOR QUALIFIED PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS: PAYMENT PAID TO EMPLOYEE)  
and that also apply to distributions to surviving spouses of employees and other beneficiaries. The surviving spouse can  
elect to have an ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION paid into a DIRECT ROLLOVER TO AN INDIVIDUAL  
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) or to the surviving spouse. If the distribution is paid directly to the surviving spouse,  
that spouse may retain it or roll it over into an IRA. Beneficiaries other than the surviving spouse cannot elect a direct  
rollover, and cannot in turn roll over the distribution. Surviving spouse's and other beneficiaries' distributions are not  
subject to the additional 10% tax penalty, even if they are under the age of 59 1/2.  
ROLLOVER INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT individual retirement account (IRA) established to receive  
distribution of assets from a qualified pension or retirement plan. For example, if employees resign from their jobs and  
receive a lump sum distribution of $75,000, they may roll it over into an IRA without paying taxes. Rollover IRAs are  
governed by the same tax rules as other IRAs. They provide a way to maintain the tax-deferred status of distributions  
from pensions or other qualified plans until an age specified by law, when withdrawals must begin.  
ROTH INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) separate account created by the Tax Relief Act of 1997 and  
named after Senator William Roth Jr. of Delaware. A working individual may contribute up to 100% of compensation  
or $2000. The lesser amount applies for each taxable year; and, the contribution must be made by April 15 (or the tax  
filing deadline) of the following year. A nonworking spouse can contribute up to $2000. These contributions are subject  
to compensation limits (not included as compensation is income received from pensions, annuities, or as deferred  
compensation) for the adjusted gross income (AGI) in the following manner: (1) single individuals with an AGI of less  
than $95,000 may contribute up to $2000; (2) married individuals filing a joint income tax return with an AGI less than  
$150,000 may contribute up to $2000; (3) partial contributions may be made by single individuals with an AGI between  
$95,000 and $110,000 and by married individuals with an AGI between $150,000 and $160,000; and, by married  
individuals filing separately with an AGI of less than $10,000. These contributions are not deductible for federal income  
tax purposes. The funds once contributed grow on a tax-free basis. Tax-free withdrawals from this IRA may be made  
after it has been in existence for at least five years and the individual has reached at least age 59 1/2. If death or  
permanent disability occurs, tax-free withdrawals can also be made. Tax-free withdrawals up to $10,000 are also  
permitted for the purchase of a first

home. Funds may be withdrawn for educational purposes subject to the payment of income tax, but there is no 10%  
penalty paid, as is the case with the traditional IRA. There is no maximum age by which the individual must start taking  
distributions as there is at the age of 70 1/2 with the traditional IRA. Even though contributions are not tax-deductible,  
these contributions can be withdrawn tax-free at any time while the earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis after  
age 59, provided the funds have been in the account for at least five years. Conversions from a traditional IRA to a Roth  
IRA may be made provided the IRA owner has an AGI of $100,000 or less. Upon conversion to a Roth IRA, income tax  
is payable on the taxable portion of the amount converted from the traditional IRA (earnings and deductible  
contributions). The amount converted from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is subject to a 10% tax penalty if withdrawn  
within five years of the conversion.  
RULE AGAINST ACCUMULATIONS state laws that prohibit for an unreasonable period of time the accumulation of  
income under the OPTION MODES OF SETTLEMENT of a LIFE INSURANCE policy unless the BENEFICIARY of  
the policy is a minor; thus, if the INTEREST OPTION is selected under the optional modes of settlement, the  
beneficiary must be a minor.  
RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES time limit on the deferred owner-ship of property such that, 21 years after the  
property owner dies, the deferred ownership of that property terminates.  
RUNNING DOWN CLAUSE coverage in liability insurance for a ship owner in the event of collision with another  
ship. A running down clause, when added to basic HULL MARINE INSURANCE, protects against liability for damage  
to the other vessel, its freight and cargo, and for lost income to the other vessel's owner during the time it cannot be used.  
RUN-OFF liability of an insurance company for future claims that it expects to pay and for which a reserve has been  
established.

coverage to be applicable, there must be signs of forcible entry into the premises in which the safe is located. See also  
MERCANTILE SAFE BURGLARY INSURANCE.  
SAFE DRIVER PLAN procedure for offering reduced auto insurance rates to drivers with good records, and imposing  
higher rates on bad drivers. Typically, premiums are weighted under a system that assigns points for traffic violations  
and accidents. The more points awarded during a certain rating period, the higher the premium. Most plans consider  
violations only during the past two or three years, giving bad drivers who improve their records a chance to reduce their  
premiums.  
SAFETY important means of preventing accidents and injuries. Insurers take corporate safety programs into account  
when rating workers compensation and other business insurance policies. See also ENGINEERING APPROACH;  
HUMAN APPROACH; LOSS PREVENTION AND REDUCTION.  
SAFETY OF ASSETS quality of investments of insurance companies. State insurance regulators establish rules for  
company investments. Authorized investments vary, depending on whether a company is a life insurer or property  
casualty company and, in some instances, on whether it is a mutual or stock company. Investments must meet standards  
for asset type, credit quality, and diversification. Generally, insurance company assets are limited to government  
securities, bonds, stocks, mortgages, and certain real estate holdings. See also ADMITTED ASSETS; LIQUIDITY OF

SAVINGS ARE VITAL TO EVERYONE RETIREMENT ACT OF 1997 act that requires the Department of Labor  
(DOL) to have a formal program to educate the public about the importance of saving for retirement. The DOL is also  
required to educate the public concerning the characteristics of the various PENSION PLANS. The act requires the  
President to conduct three national summits on retirement savings in the years 1998, 2001, and 2005.

SAVINGS BANK LIFE INSURANCE (SBLI) low-cost life insurance sold by savings banks in the states of  
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. SBLI is a popular source of life insurance in these states for two reasons: it  
is offered in bank lobbies, which makes it convenient; and there are no commissions, as with commercial life insurance,  
which makes it cheaper. Although banks generally are barred from the insurance business, SBLI was allowed by these  
three states at the urging of consumer groups. Other states have refused to adopt similar legislation. Maximum policy  
amounts are limited by state law.  
SAVINGS ELEMENT cash value of life insurance that accumulates according to a table in a policy. It reflects  
premiums in the early years that exceed the pure cost of protection during that period. If a policy is surrendered, the  
policyowner receives the cash surrender value and the insurance ends. This is why a cash value policy can be  
considered a savings or investment vehicle. Cash value is also the part of a life insurance product used as an investment  
for an INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA).  
SAVINGS ELEMENT, LIFE INSURANCE buildup of policy cash value, as distinguished from the death benefit. A  
policyholder has a choice between surrendering the policy for its cash surrender value or keeping it in force for its death  
benefit. The rates of return on cash value policies, such as whole life insurance, universal life, or variable life, depend  
on schedules in the insurance contract or, in some types of policies, on prevailing interest rates or the performance of an  
investment portfolio. See also CASH SURRENDER VALUE.  
SAVINGS INCENTIVE MATCH PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES (SIMPLE PLANS) small business retirement plans  
created by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. These plans permit small business owners who have fewer  
than 100 employees to establish an employee retirement plan. Because the required administration of these plans is  
much less than that required of traditional plans, the cost is low as compared to traditional plans.  
There are two types of simple plans made available under the 1996 act: the simple IRA and the simple 401 (k). Under  
both simple plans, employers are required to contribute a 3% match for all plan participants' salaries or a 2% match for  
eligible employees, regardless of whether or not the employees participate in the plan. An exemption to this rule is that  
under the simple IRA, but not under the simple 401(k), the employer may lower the 3% match to 1% for every two  
years out of a five-year period of time. Under both simple plans, all employer matches are immediately VESTED in the  
employees, which is not the case with traditional retirement plans.  
The simple IRA must be the only retirement plan provided by the employer and it must exclude any ROLLOVERS  
from any other non-simple IRA plans. All employees that earn at least $5000 annually must be eligible to participate on  
a SALARY REDUCTION PLAN basis if so elected

by the employees. Contributions to this plan are not subject to federal income tax and are not subject to  
nondiscrimination or top-heavy rules applicable to qualified plans. Distributions made from the plan prior to age 59 1/2  
are subject to a 10% surcharge as a penalty, and, in addition, if that distribution is made during the first two years that  
the employee is participating in the plan, the surcharge becomes 25% of the amount distributed. Transfer from a simple  
IRA to a regular IRA is permitted only after the employee has participated in the simple IRA for at least two years. If a  
transfer is made earlier than the two-year requirement, it is subject to a 25% surcharge. Upon termination of  
employment, the simple plan becomes a regular IRA provided the two-year rule has expired. Simple IRAs do not allow  
loans. The HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996 (HIPA ACT) stipulates  
that the IRA owner is not subject to the 10% penalty for distributions prior to age 59 1/2 if the distributions are used to  
pay medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of the adjusted gross income.

SCHEDULED LIMIT specified limit on the dollar amount of coverage for a given loss.  
SCHEDULED PERSONAL PROPERTY ENDORSEMENT addition to a HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, or  
other personal or business property policies, to provide extra coverage for listed articles. The standard policy has dollar  
limits on certain items, such as jewelry, furs, art, or guns. This endorsement allows a policyholder to purchase additional  
coverage for specific items of property, with each item or group of items, and the amount of coverage, listed.  
SCHEDULED POLICY policy permitting an insured to choose desired coverages. These policies are important for  
items with relatively low limits of coverage under standard property insurance forms. For example, an insured would  
have to specifically schedule expensive jewelry, furs, and paintings in order to receive full value for a loss.  
SCHEDULE FLOATER see FLOATER.  
SCHEDULE INJURY injury covered under WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. For every part of the body  
that may be injured, there is a listed financial sum that will be paid. For example, a right severed index finger in a

entitled to these benefits as a matter of right as established by statutory law.

SCHEDULE Q see Q SCHEDULE.  
SCHEDULE RATING method of pricing property and liability insurance. It uses charges and credits to modify a class  
rate based on the special characteristics of the risk. Insurers have been able to develop a schedule of rates because  
experience has shown a direct relationship between certain physical characteristics and the possibility of loss. For  
example, for fire insurance, the underwriter might make an additional charge above the standard rate for the class if a  
building contains a flammable liquid. A credit may be given if it has a sprinkler system. In automobile insurance, a  
credit might be given for driver education. In life insurance, credit is usually given for a nonsmoker. Schedule rating is  
commonly used for fire, automobile and workers compensation insurance. See also EXPERIENCE RATING;  
PREMIUM DISCOUNT; RETROSPECTIVE RATING.  
SCLP see SIMPLIFIED COMMERCIAL LINES PORTFOLIO (SCLP).  
''S" CORPORATIONS corporations that have elected to be taxed according to the provisions of Subchapter S of the  
Internal Revenue Code. In order to qualify under these provisions, the corporation can have only one class of stock. By  
so qualifying, tax is eliminated at the corporate level and the shareholders are taxed on their proportionate share of the  
corporation's profit. This is important because currently the highest individual income tax rate is lower than the highest  
corporate income tax rate.  
SCREENS system established for checking claims to determine whether they should be paid immediately or checked

SEASONAL RISK exposure present only at certain times of the year. For example, resort property faces a business

SEAWORTHINESS ADMITTED CLAUSE part of a marine cargo policy that exempts the policyholder from vouching  
for the seaworthiness of the vessel. For example, while a purchaser of HULL MARINE INSURANCE warrants that a

< previous page page_452 next page >

SECONDARY PLAN see COORDINATION OF BENEFITS.  
SECOND DEATH INSURANCE life insurance policy with a death benefit that is paid only when the second of two  
insureds dies. No benefits are paid as long as both live or if just one lives.  
SECOND-INJURY FUND insurance fund set up by most states to encourage employers to hire handicapped workers.  
Where workers with existing handicaps suffer further work-related injuries or diseases that result in total disability, the  
employer is responsible for the workers compensation benefit only for the second injury or disease. The fund makes up  
the difference between the benefit for total disability and the benefit for the second injury. Second-injury funds are  
financed through general state revenues or assessments on workers compensation insurers.  
SECOND MORTGAGE mortgage loan secured by real estate that already has a first mortgage. In case of default, the  
claim of the second mortgage holder is subordinate to that of the first mortgage holder. Generally, insurance companies  
are not permitted by state laws to offer or invest in second mortgages.  
SECOND SURPLUS REINSURANCE amount of REINSURANCE accepted by a second REINSURER which is in  
excess of the original insurer's retention limit and the first reinsurer's first surplus treaty's limit. See also RETENTION  
AND LIMITS CLAUSE, SURPLUS REINSURANCE.  
SECOND-TO-DIE see SECOND DEATH INSURANCE.  
SECTION 79 PLAN group whole life insurance policy designed to reduce an employee's exposure to income tax on the  
value of life insurance provided by the employer. The policy separates the term element from the cash value element,  
and apportions part of the premium to each. The plan takes advantage of the tax exemption to employees on a specified  
amount of group term insurance plans and the special tax rate on the premium for the amount of insurance over that  
amount.  
SECTION 101 (a) (1) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE section of the code that qualifies that the death benefit  
paid under a life insurance policy is received by the BENEFICIARY income-tax free. These tax consequences apply  
regardless of the size of the CASH VALUE of the policy, total premiums paid, who the POLICYOWNER may be, who  
the INSURED may be, who the premium payor may be, or who the beneficiary may be.  
SECTION 105 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE federal statute that permits the self-employed a 100% tax  
deduction for the family health care expenses to include HEALTH INSURANCE premiums, DISABILITY  
< previous page page_453 next page >  
 
< previous page page_454 next page >  
Page 454  
INCOME insurance premiums, and LONG-TERM CARE insurance premiums. Also deductible on a 100% basis are  
noninsured medical, dental, and vision care expenses.  
SECTION 105 MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT PLAN eligible employees reimbursed from the employer for family  
health care expenses paid by those employees to include HEALTH INSURANCE premiums, DISABILITY INCOME  
insurance premiums, and LONG-TERM CARE insurance premiums. Also reimbursable to the employees from the  
employer are non-insured medical expenses. The employer receives a 100% tax deduction for this reimbursement.  
SECTION 125 PLANS (CAFETERIA PLANS) additions made by Congress in 1978 to the Internal Revenue Code that  
provide an employee benefit plan under which the employee makes an irrevocable decision to forego a portion of future  
income in exchange for receiving future benefits not subject to income tax at reception date. The employer deducts the  
cost of the employee's future benefits from present income as a business expense. These plans usually provide three  
options:  
1. Premium ConversionEmployee contributes a proportionate share of the family health care costs with pre-tax dollars.  
2. Medical Reimbursement AccountEmployee is able to use a SALARY REDUCTION PLAN to pay with dollars on a  
pre-tax basis for medical expenses not covered by insurance; a separate medical reimbursement account is established  
for each employee.  
3. Dependent Care Reimbursement AccountEmployee is able to use a salary reduction plan to pay with dollars on a pretax  
basis for dependent care expenses.  
An additional option sometimes provided for employees only (family members are excluded) is TERM LIFE  
INSURANCE for an amount up to $50,000 and DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE. All employees must have equal  
access to the plans whether they are highly compensated or nonhighly compensated employees. Any monies left in the  
employee's account not used by the end of the year revert back to the company; this is known as the Use It or Lose It  
rule. As the employee incurs expenses, that employee applies for reimbursement through a form attached to the bill.  
When the administrator of the plan issues a check to the employee for the expenses, a statement is also provided that  
shows the amount remaining in the employee's account.  
SECTION 401 (h) PENSION PLAN TRUST trust established under the auspices of the Internal Revenue Code that  
permits the maintenance of a separate account within the employer's DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN from  
which to pay the employee's life insurance and medical expense costs. Contributions to this account are tax deductible,  
and the investment's earnings accumulate on a tax deferred basis.

SECTION 401 (k) PLAN (SALARY REDUCTION PLAN) employer sponsored retirement savings program named for  
the section of the Internal Revenue Code that permits it. These plans allow employees to invest pre-tax dollars that are  
often matched in some portion by employers. Because of their flexibility, 401 (k)s became a popular employee benefit  
during the 1980s. But the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986 limited their use as short-term savings plans by imposing a  
10% penalty on all money withdrawn before retirement. It also reduced the maximum annual contribution from $30,000  
to $7000 and tightened nondiscrimination rules. Employees may still borrow the money, however, and pay themselves  
interest.  
SECTION 401 (k) PLAN SWITCHBACKS (KSOPs) device that allows plan participants in EMPLOYEE STOCK  
OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) TRUST to reinvest the dividends into their SECTION 401 (K) PLAN. Under the  
switchback approach, plan participants are permitted to select whether they wish to reinvest their dividends paid on the  
company's stock into the KSOP on a tax-deferred basis or take the dividends in cash and be subject to ordinary income  
tax. If the plan participant elects to reinvest the dividends into the KSOP, the participant's contribution to the Section  
401 (k) is reduced by the amount of the dividend. The KSOP concept allows dividends to be retained in the retirement  
plan and permits the plan participant to increase the amount of his or her contribution into the plan by the amount of  
dividends reinvested.  
SECTION 403 (b) PLAN retirement plan offered by public employers and tax-exempt organizations. Under Section 403  
(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, certain tax-exempt organizations such as public school systems can make payments  
for retirement annuity policies for their employees and have the payments excluded from the employees' gross income  
for tax purposes, subject to certain limitations.  
SECTION 404 (c) OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 section of the act  
stating that regulation requires employers to offer plan participants at least three diversified investment choices. Each  
choice must have materially different risk and return characteristics. Participants must be given the opportunity to  
switch from one fund to another on at least a quarterly basis. Also, employers must provide sufficient information for  
participants to make informed investment decisions.  
SECTION 408 (k) PLAN section of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE  
PENSIONS (SEP).  
SECTION 457 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN plan in which a public employer (such as a university, state,  
county, or municipality) sponsors a retirement savings program, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code  
that permits it. This plan allows the employer, upon agreement with the employee, to reduce the employee's salary by a  
specific amount and invest this amount, with pre-tax dollars, in  
< previous page page_455 next page >  
 
< previous page page_456 next page >  
Page 456  
various financial instruments. Upon termination of employment, the principal amount invested and any investment  
earnings are distributed to the terminating employee or the employee's estate. A deferred FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY  
or VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY are among the financial instruments that can be used to fund this plan.  
SECTION 501 (c) (9) VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEES BENEFICIARY ASSOCIATION (VEBA) trust established under  
the Internal Revenue Service code that is used to provide accident and sickness benefits to member employees.  
SECTION 1035 EXCHANGE section of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for the taking of the proceeds from  
one LIFE INSURANCE policy or ANNUITY and the reinvesting of these proceeds immediately in another life  
insurance policy or annuity of the same type without being required to pay a tax on any gain. This exchange should be  
handled by the seller of the REPLACEMENT, LIFE INSURANCE policy or annuity.  
SECTION 2503 (c) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE section of the code that qualifies the establishment of a  
trust for minors under which income can be accumulated until the minor reaches age 21. At that point, the accumulated  
income can be disbursed and the $10,000 annual GIFT TAX EXCLUSION for each beneficiary can be utilized.  
SECTION 4958 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE portion of a federal law that imposes a penalty excise tax on  
an EXCESS BENEFIT TRANSACTION of 25% of the excess benefit on the person from inside the organization  
(DISQUALIFIED PERSON) receiving the benefit. Also imposed is a penalty excise tax of 10% of the excess benefit on  
the manager within the organization awarding the excess benefit. If this excess amount is not repaid to the tax-exempt  
organization within a reasonable period of time, the disqualified person incurs an additional tax penalty of 200% of the  
excess benefit received.  
SECULAR TRUST [402(b)] (NONEXEMPT TRUST) NONQUALIFIED PLAN of DEFERRED COMPENSATION  
whose goal is to compensate KEY EMPLOYEES without having to provide similar benefits to rank and file employees.  
The TRUST is irrevocable, and funds placed in it are protected against claims made by the company's creditors. Even  
though funds in this trust are not in the employee's possession, they are deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to have  
been constructively received by the employee. The company is allowed to take an income tax deduction for the funds it  
contributed to the trust, even though these funds have not been distributed to the employee while he or she has current  
taxable income. At the time funds from the trust are actually distributed, the employee is taxed only to the extent that  
these distributions are from earnings of the trust or from current trust income, which will allow the employee to pay  
taxes owed as the result of the company's contributions to the trust. The employer is not taxed on the trust income: the  
employee pays all taxes on this income. For example,  
< previous page page_456 next page >  
 
< previous page page_457 next page >  
Page 457  
assume that the company is in the 34% tax bracket and contributed $40,000 to the trust on behalf of John Employee,  
who is in the 28% tax bracket. The result is that John Employee will have an $11,200 tax liability ($40,000 28%) and  
the company will incur a $13,600 tax deduction ($40,000 34%). In order that John Employee will have the necessary  
funds to pay the taxes owed, the company usually will bonus him the $11,200 required, which of course is tax  
deductible as a business expense for the company.

businesses with 100 or fewer employees that do not currently provide employees with a DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN or  
a DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN (MONEY PURCHASE PLAN). In order to qualify for this new pension plan,  
neither a defined benefit plan nor a defined contribution plan could have been offered by the business to its employees  
during the previous five years.

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 landmark legislation passed by Congress providing the first regulation of the securities  
markets. The law, enforced by the SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), requires registration of  
securities issues and disclosure of material information about the financial condition of the issuers. Variable annuity and  
VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE policies have been determined to be securities under the terms of this law and thus are  
subject to regulation both by the SEC and by state insurance departments.  
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) federal agency that regulates the securities markets. The  
independent, five-member commission was created under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to enforce the  
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. Members are appointed by the president and serve five-year terms. The SEC has  
responsibility to regulate securities exchanges and markets, to set disclosure and accounting rules for most issuers of  
corporate securities, and to oversee securities firms, investment companies, and investment advisers.

The mechanism works as follows: Primary insurance company AJAX pays a premium to  
< previous page page_458 next page >  
 
< previous page page_459 next page >  
Page 459  
purchase a CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE contract from REINSURANCE company BJAX. Reinsurance company  
BJAX then sells its bonds in an amount equal to the catastrophe reinsurance contract issued to insurance company  
AJAX. The proceeds from the bonds sold by BJAX are then placed in a trust to securitize the reinsurance contract.  
Interest is earned on the proceeds placed in the trust; the proceeds are usually invested in United States Treasury issues.  
If AJAX does not have any reinsurance claims, the purchasers of the bonds receive the return of the amount they have  
invested (safely on deposit in the trust) plus interest earned. If AJAX does have a reinsurance claim, the claim is paid  
out of the trust with the payment coming from the initial amount invested in the bonds plus interest earned. The  
investors in the bonds incur a bond default. The rating of these bonds uses the same criteria as used for all types of  
bonds, whether corporate or government, that is the probability of default. Just like any other type of bond, whether  
corporate or government, the price of the bond and thus the yield increases or decreases subject to market conditions.  
SECURITY VALUATION rules used by state regulators to value securities on the books of insurance companies.  
Bonds with acceptable credit quality are carried at amortized value, which is the face value plus or minus the amount of  
any purchase discount or premium, as amortized over the life of the bond. Preferred stock is valued at cost and  
COMMON STOCK INVESTMENTS at year-end market price. Valuations for impaired securities such as bonds in  
default are determined by the Committee on Valuation of Securities of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC). See also MANDATORY SECURITIES VALUATION RESERVE.  
SEGREGATION OF EXPOSURE UNITS risk management practice designed to control losses by physically separating  
assets or operations (on separating a single exposure unit into various parts) to reduce maximum potential loss. The  
objective of such a separation is to reduce the risk of loss to the whole exposure unit through dispersion. For example,  
two related chemical processing operations, both subject to loss from explosion or fire, would be built a sufficient  
distance apartperhaps even on separate premisesso that the explosion of one would not damage the other.

SELECTION OF RISK see RISK SELECTION; UNDERWRITING.  
SELECT MORTALITY TABLE MORTALITY TABLE that includes data only on people who have recently purchased  
life insurance. Experience shows that such people have a lower mortality rate in the years immediately following their  
purchase of insurance than those who have been insured for some time, probably because they have recently passed  
medical and other tests, and because they are younger. For example, a  
< previous page page_459 next page >  
 
< previous page page_460 next page >  
Page 460  
select mortality table would show the number of deaths per 1000 of individuals age 30 who have been insured for one  
year. An ULTIMATE MORTALITY TABLE shows the rate of the group, exclusive of the initial period after the  
purchase of insurance. An aggregate mortality table includes all data.  
SELF-ADMINISTERED PLAN qualified pension or other employee benefit where responsibility rests with an  
employer rather than an insurer. A TRUST FUND plan, where assets are deposited with and invested by a trustee, is the  
most common self-administered plan. A TRUST AGREEMENT governs the plan administration and retirees are paid  
benefits from the trust or the trustee buys annuities for them. The self-administered, or trust fund plan, contrasts with  
the insured (insurance company) pension plan.  
SELF-DIRECTED ACCOUNT type of INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) allowed by the  
EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) in which contributions are paid into a  
custodial account sponsored by a bank or stockbroker. The owner of the account selects the types of investments into  
which the contributions are made.  
SELF FUNDING see SELF INSURANCE.  
SELF-INFLICTED INJURY intentional injury caused by the person injured. For life and health insurance purposes,  
self-inflicted injury typically is not covered by accident policies, because it is intentional, not an accident. This applies  
for WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE purposes as well. However, for life insurance purposes, suicide is  
covered after the policy has been in force for two years.  
SELF INSURANCE protecting against loss by setting aside one's own money. This can be done on a mathematical  
basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis. Through self insurance it is  
possible to protect against high-FREQUENCY, low-severity losses. To do this through an insurance company would  
mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on  
the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies.  
SELF-INSURED EXCESS PLAN plan for excess layer(s) of insurance coverage over the primary coverage, for  
example, if a corporation buys $8 million as excess above a $2 million SELF INSURANCE retention level. Excess  
coverage can be purchased from either a PRIMARY INSURER or a REINSURER. Before deciding on a self-insurance  
plan, the corporation should review its past loss experience according to pattern, timing, and types, as well as its current  
financial position.  
SELF-INSURED RETENTION (SIR) portion of a property or liability loss retained by a policyholder. Most  
policyholders do not purchase insurance to cover their entire exposure. Rather, they elect to take a deductible, or portion  
that they will cover themselves. For example, a  
< previous page page_460 next page >  
 
< previous page page_461 next page >  
Page 461  
homeowner may purchase $150,000 worth of insurance with a $500 deductible for certain losses, such as roof damage  
by hail. The $500 deductible is one form of self insurance. It means the homeowner will cover all losses for that amount  
or less. See also SELF INSURANCE.  
SELF-INSURER see SELF INSURANCE; SELF-INSURED RETENTION (SIR).  
SELF-PROCURED INSURANCE policy purchased by the insured from a NONADMITTED INSURER. This policy  
can be purchased directly from the insurer by the insured.  
SELF-REGULATION action by insurance companies and agents to voluntarily refrain from business conduct that is  
misleading, fraudulent, and in general would have adverse consequences for the purchaser of the insurance product.  
SELF-SELECTION effort of a poor risk to seek insurance coverage. The onset of a health problem such as heart  
disease, for example, may prompt a person to apply for life insurance before seeking medical treatment. Such  
applicants, if not screened out, would weight the insured pool toward bad risks. The UNDERWRITING process is  
intended to counter the natural tendency toward self-selection among insurance applicants, either by requiring higher  
rates for poorer risks or by denying them coverage. See also ADVERSE SELECTION.  
SELF-TRUSTEED TRUST arrangement in which individuals serve as trustees of their own LIVING TRUST and name  
another party (successor trustee) to manage the assets if they should become incapacitated. In this type of trust,  
individuals are assured that their assets will continue to be managed as desired without interruption.  
SELLING AGENTS' COMMISSION INSURANCE coverage that provides for the indemnification of a salesperson for  
the amount of his or her lost commission on a product to be sold that cannot be produced because of damage incurred  
by the manufacturer or that, once produced, cannot be delivered by the manufacturer because of damage incurred. See  
also CONTINGENT BUSINESS INTERRUPTION FORM.  
SELLING PRICE CLAUSE property insurance coverage available to businesses that pays the established market (sales)  
value of products that are damaged rather than simply their lower (production) cost. This fills the gap between  
ACTUAL CASH VALUE, which provides coverage only for the cost to the insured, and BUSINESS INTERRUPTION  
INSURANCE. For manufacturers, it covers the cost of all finished goods; for mercantile firms, it applies only to goods  
that have been sold but are not yet delivered.  
SEMIENDOWMENT INSURANCE modified ENDOWMENT INSURANCE policy under which the insured receives  
one-half the DEATH BENEFIT as the MATURITY VALUE of the policy.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACT (GIC) type of GUARANTEED  
INVESTMENT CONTRACT in which funds for the contract are placed in the insurance company's separate account.  
SEPARATE PROPERTY property acquired before marriageby gift, by inheritance, or bought with separate monies.  
SERIES EE SAVINGS BONDS bonds sold at a discount from their face value; accumulated interest paid at maturity, as  
in the case of ZERO COUPON BONDS. Interest rate minimum is guaranteed with the prevailing interest rate adjusted  
semiannually. As with all U.S. Treasury issues, interest earned on these bonds is exempt from state and local taxes.  
Federal income tax on the interest earned does not have to be prepaid until the bonds reach maturity.  
SERIES OF CATASTROPHES hazard covered under catastrophe reinsurance. This form of EXCESS OF LOSS  
REINSURANCE protects the CEDING COMPANY for loss above the retention limit caused by multiple catastrophic  
events. See also CATASTROPHE HAZARD; CATASTROPHE LOSS.

SERVICEMEN'S GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (SGLI) U.S. government group term life insurance for male and female  
members of the federal uniformed forces on active duty, underwritten by private insurance companies. Premiums reflect  
peacetime mortality rates for this group, with any additional costs of military risks (such as wartime exposure) being  
borne by the federal government. Upon discharge, SGLI policies can be converted either to five-year nonrenewable  
term VETERANS GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (VGLI) or to a permanent policy at the veteran's attained age (at higher  
cost) with one of the commercial insurance companies participating in the servicemen's plan.  
SERVICE PLANS types of insurance coverage under which health care benefits are provided to the covered individuals  
instead of monetary

reimbursement for health care expenses. See also BLUE CROSS; BLUE SHIELD.  
SERVICES OFFERED POLICYHOLDERS range of administrative and risk management services that can be  
purchased by an insured. Increasingly, insurance can be purchased UNBUNDLED so that policy-holders may pay for  
straight coverage without available services. However, some policyholders may want to purchase from the insurer  
additional services such as loss control, claims adjustment, captive management, or other services.  
SETBACK see AGE SETBACK.  
SET CLAUSE (PAIR OR SET CLAUSE) provision in many business and personal policies that loss or damage to one  
of a pair or set of individual items does not represent the loss of the pair or set. For example, the loss of one diamond  
earring would not entitle an insured to be reimbursed for a pair of earrings, but for only the resulting decrease in the  
overall pre-loss value of the pair.  
SETTLEMENT disposition of a claim or policy benefit. Policies may specify time limits for payment of claims or  
benefits and designate various methods of settlement at the option of the insurer or the insured. See also OPTIONAL  
MODES OF SETTLEMENT; SETTLEMENT OPTIONS; PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE.

SETTLEMENT OPTIONS, LIFE INSURANCE see OPTIONAL MODES OF SETTLEMENT.  
SETTLEMENT OPTIONS, PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE methods for payment of the value of a  
policy. An insurance company can select one of three options in settlement of a loss: (1) make a cash payment; (2) take  
possession of damaged or destroyed property and replace it with property of like kind and quality; or (3) repair the  
property so that it is restored to its structural condition prior to the loss, and return the repaired property to the insured.  
Usually insurance companies settle losses by a cash payment to the insured.

SEX demographic designation used in life insurance to calculate premium rates for life and health insurance and  
annuity contracts. Since females have a longer LIFE EXPECTANCY than males of the same age, life insurance  
premiums for females are lower than for males of the same age. Annuity income for females, by the same token, is  
lower than for males of the same age. These differences are being contested.  
SEX DISCRIMINATION classification of insured life and health risks based on the sex of the proposed insured.  
Gender has long been one of many factors in classifying, accepting, and rating risks. For example, because experience  
shows that women live longer than men, life insurance rates for women are lower. By the same token, annuity payments  
are lower for women because it is expected that they will be paid out for more years. On the other hand, women have  
sometimes paid lower rates for auto insurance. Insurance rating by sex became an issue in the early 1980s when many  
women charged that it was discriminatory. They demanded through UNISEX LEGISLATION to be rated no differently.  
Although insurers have resisted it, individual states have passed laws prohibiting the use of sex in risk classification. See  
also RISK CLASSIFICATION.

SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT 1890 law prohibiting monopolies and restraint of trade in interstate commerce. The  
Sherman Act was strengthened in 1914 with amendments known as the Clayton Act that added further prohibitions  
against price-fixing conspiracies. These federal antitrust laws at first were not applied to the insurance industry because  
of the 1869 Supreme Court ruling in PAUL V. VIRGINIA that insurance was not commerce and thus not subject to  
federal regulation. After the SOUTH-EASTERN UNDERWRITERS ASSOCIATION (SEUA) CASE in 1944 and  
passage of the MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT (PUBLIC LAW 15) in 1945, Congress made it clear that states would  
retain the power to regulate insurance but price-fixing and restraint of trade not sanctioned by state laws and regulations  
would be subject to federal antitrust prosecution.  
SHIP INSURANCE, PLEASURE CRAFT AND COMMERCIAL see MARINE INSURANCE.  
SHIPPERS RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION INSURANCE coverage for shippers of certain radioactive materials,  
such as medical or commercial isotopes, for direct loss or damage by radioactive contamination; does not cover

and the other for transport on vehicles operated by or for an insured. See also MOTOR TRUCK CARGO

instruments. See also REINSURANCE, PROPERTY AND CASUALTYCASUALTY CATASTROPHE.  
SHORE CLAUSE provision in MARINE INSURANCE listing onshore perils covered. In the case of marine cargo,  
these may include such occur-rences as damage from flooding, sprinklers, collapse of docks, and wharf or warehouse  
fires. It may also cover damage from accidents during ground transportation.  
SHORT PERIOD INSURANCE coverage for less than one year in duration.  
SHORT RATE CANCELLATION cancellation by the insured of a property or disability insurance policy for which the  
returned unearned premium is diminished by administration costs incurred when the insurance company placed the  
policy on its books.  
SHORT RATE PREMIUM premium charge for a policy that is going to be in force for less than the normal period of  
time.  
SHORT RATE, SHORT TERM INSURANCE coverage for less than one year. Insurers generally charge higher rates  
for short-term policies than for longer term insurance, such as an ANNUAL POLICY, because of (1) the need to recoup  
relatively fixed administrative and processing costs over a shorter policy life; and (2) the likelihood of ADVERSE  
SELECTION, with buyers seeking insurance only at times of the year when they know they face greatest likelihood of  
loss.  
SHORT RATE TABLE display of percentage of earned premiums as a function of the time in days for term property  
insurance policies originally written for one year or longer. These tables are used to compute the refund or the excess of  
the paid premium above the customary short rate for the expired term in the event the INSURED cancels the policy  
(makes a SHORT RATE CANCELLATION).  
SHORT TERM DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE see DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE.

SHORT TERM REVERSIONARY TRUST financial instrument established irrevocably for a minimum of 10 years,  
after which the principal reverts to the grantor upon termination of the trust. A key feature is that earnings from the  
principal traditionally have been taxed at the beneficiary's tax rate instead of the presumably higher tax rate  
< previous page page_465 next page >  
 
< previous page page_466 next page >  
Page 466  
of the grantor. An example is the CLIFFORD TRUST commonly used to save for a child's college expenses. Another  
example is the funded irrevocable LIFE INSURANCE TRUST. Under a typical arrangement, a grandparent might  
establish such a trust to fund premiums for permanent insurance on the life of a son or daughter, with the grandchildren  
as beneficiaries. At termination of the trust, the grandchildren would have a fully paid policy on their parent's life, and  
the trust assets would revert to the grandparent. Congress curtailed the tax advantages of short-term reversionary trusts  
in the Tax Reform Act of 1969 and again in the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986.  
SICK BUILDING SYNDROME condition in which buildings are built with sealed windows resulting in poor  
ventilation causing occupants to experience dizziness, nausea, respiratory problems, headaches, fatigue, sinus  
congestion, and/or respiratory problems. This health concern has the potential for substantially increasing health and  
WORKERS COMPENSATION claims.

SIDETRACK AGREEMENT type of hold-harmless agreement made by a property owner as a condition for being  
served by a railroad spur. If the owner wants a special sidetrack, the railroad requires the owner to assume responsibility  
for certain losses for property damage or injury arising from use of the track, even if the railroad is at fault. Most  
common in these agreements is responsibility for loss due to fire.  
SIDETRACK INSURANCE see SIDETRACK AGREEMENT.  
SIGN FLOATER INSURANCE endorsement to a business property floater policy that covers neon signs for all perils,  
both while they are being moved and once they are in place. Signs that are attached to a building can be covered under  
the underlying property insurance. The sign floater policy provides broader coverage for each sign that is listed on the  
policy.  
SIMPLE INTEREST sum of money paid on the principal amount of money invested or loaned. See also INTEREST.  
SIMPLE PROBABILITY see PROBABILITY.  
SIMPLIFIED COMMERCIAL LINES PORTFOLIO POLICY (SCLP) policy that provides coverage through four parts:  
1. Commercial propertycoverage is provided under the BUILDING AND PERSONAL PROPERTY COVERAGE  
FORM (BPPCF), divided into three major categories: owned buildings, owned business personal property, and  
nonowned business personal property.  
2. Crimecoverage is provided under the commercial crime program, which includes the following coverages: forgery;  
theft, dis-appearance, and destruction; employee dishonesty; safe robbery  
< previous page page_466 next page >  
 
< previous page page_467 next page >  
Page 467  
and burglary; burglary of the premises; computer fraud; extortion; and liability for the property of guests.  
3. Boiler and machinerycoverage is provided according to four items of classification: electrical, turbine, mechanical,  
and pressure and refrigeration. Property covered in these four groups is that which is owned by the insured or is under  
the care, custody, or control of the insured.  
4. Liabilitycoverage is provided for general liability, products and completed operations liability, medical payments,  
advertising and personal liability, and fire legal liability. Each of these categories has a separate limit of liability that is  
applicable. However, an annual AGGREGATE LIMIT of liability is applicable to the total of these categories except for  
the products and completed operations liability, which has a separate annual aggregate limit.  
SIMPLIFIED EARNINGS FORM addition to a business property insurance policy to cover loss of earnings, subject to  
a monthly limit, in the event that property of an insured is destroyed and a business cannot continue. The property  
insurance policy pays only in the event that property of an insured is destroyed and a business cannot continue. The  
property insurance policy pays only for DIRECT LOSS of income-producing property. A building destroyed by fire  
represents a direct loss. Lost income resulting from the shutdown of a manufacturing facility housed in the burned  
building represents an INDIRECT LOSS that would be covered by BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, which  
is written on a number of separate forms.  
SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION (SEP) employee INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT funded by an  
employer or a self-employed person. (Also known as SEP-IRA.) Differs from a pension plan in that contributions are  
immediately vested and employees have control of the investment of the SEP-IRA. IRS rules require that SEP-IRA  
contributions be made according to a written allocation formula. The maximum contribution is 15% of compensation or  
$30,000, whichever is less. Employees may elect to take cash instead of their SEP-IRA contribution but must pay  
income taxes on it. The TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986 also allows a SEP-IRA to be used as an alternative to a  
SECTION 401 (K) PLAN (SALARY REDUCTION PLAN) for an employer with 25 or fewer employees. The  
maximum annual contribution limit per employee for such salary-reduction SEP-IRAs is $7000.  
SINE QUA NON RULE Latin phrase meaning ''without which not," signifying a legal rule in TORT and  
NEGLIGENCE cases. Under this rule, a plaintiff trying to prove that an injury was a direct result of a negligent act by  
the defendant would have to establish that the injury would not have occurred without the negligent act.  
SINGLE ANNUITANT (SINGLE LIFE ANNUITY) ANNUITY that continues income payments as long as the

SINGLE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE coverage in which one premium payment is made and the policy is fully paid  
up with no further premiums required. See also LIMITED PAYMENT LIFE INSURANCE.  
SINGLE PREMIUM VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE type of UNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE  
INSURANCE policy that provides guideline premiums to be paid usually by the POLICYOWNER. Charges on a  
monthly basis usually include the COST OF INSURANCE, administrative expenses, premium tax, and in some  
instances, a contract fee. The policyowner may execute POLICY LOANS and in many instances on a zero cost basis if  
the policy loans come from the policy's gains. The policyowner may also make a partial CASH SURRENDER VALUE  
of policy at no SURRENDER CHARGE for that portion of the premium not previously surrendered. When surrender  
charges are levied, they usually apply for the first 10 years that the policy is in force and range from 6 to 15% in the first  
year decreasing to zero by the end of the tenth year. Within the policy, the policyowner can effect tax-free transfers of  
funds among the sub-accounts in order to try to optimize the return.  
SINGLE RISK CARGO INSURANCE marine cargo coverage for a single shipment of goods. Also known as  
SPECIAL RISK INSURANCE and trip cargo insurance. Contrasts with open policy cargo insurance that covers all of  
a shipper's goods in transit.  
SINKING FUND money set aside to pay for losses. Rather than buy insurance coverage for all potential losses, some  
businesses and individuals choose this form of SELF INSURANCE to cover all or a portion of certain losses.

SISTERSHIP EXCLUSION part of the BUSINESS RISK EXCLUSION in GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE that  
denies coverage for subsequent claims if a defective product is not recalled by an insured. For example, if a consumer  
filed a damage suit against XYZ Co. claiming that he or she became sick while eating a can of soup from a particular lot  
that was contaminated, the insurer would not pay later claims filed by other consumers if the XYZ Co. did not recall  
that lot of the soup. The general liability insurance policy for businesses also excludes costs associated with the  
withdrawal of a product from the market whether it is ordered by a government agency or by company management. A  
business that wants coverage for product recall would need to buy PRODUCT RECALL INSURANCE to include the  
extra wages and other costs of identifying the faulty product, notifying consumers, correcting or repairing the product,  
and redistributing it.

SLIDING SCALE COMMISSION percentage that has an inverse relationship to the loss experience on the business

SMALL BUSINESS PROTECTION ACT act passed in 1996 that includes  
1. an increase in the amount a nonworking spouse can contribute to an INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT  
(IRA) increased from $250 to $2000.  
2. creation of the SAVINGS INCENTIVE MATCH PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES (SIMPLE PLANS).  
3. the stipulation that, for the person covered under a QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN who is age 70 1/2 and has not  
retired, that person is not required to begin minimum distributions from that plan until April 1 of the year following the  
year in which he or she retires.  
SMALL LOSS PRINCIPLE statement regarding an insured's retention of low-severity risks because they are not  
catastrophic, and can be absorbed without having a dramatic effect on the financial structure of a business or individual.  
Insurance purchased for small-loss coverage is, in effect, swapping dollars with the insurance company, since the  
premium charged reflects the individual's expected losses plus loadings for the insurance company's expenses, profit  
margin, and contingencies. See also LARGE LOSS PRINCIPLE.

SOCIAL INSURANCE compulsory employee benefit plan under which participants are entitled to a series of benefits  
as a matter of right. The plan is administered by a federal or state government agency and has as its objective the  
provision of a minimum standard of living for those in lower and middle wage groups. See also SOCIAL SECURITY  
ACT OF 1935.  
SOCIAL INSURANCE SUPPLEMENT additional coverage designed to provide protection against economic losses  
incurred by insured wage earners when their income is interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or  
accident, and these losses are not covered under WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE disability income  
benefits or the disability income benefits of Social Security.  
SOCIAL SECURITY ACT OF 1935 federal legislation that established the OLD AGE SURVIVORS, DISABILITY,

SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, TITLE XIX 1965 federal law that provides for medical assistance to those who cannot  
afford to pay for it. Four categories of the needy can qualify: aged, blind, disabled, and families with dependent  
children. The MEDICAID program was enacted at the same time as MEDICARE.  
SOCIAL SECURITY ADJUSTMENT OPTION choice an employee can make of receiving higher private pension  
benefits prior to eligibility for Social Security, and lower pension benefits thereafter. For example, employees taking  
early retirement may wish to receive higher-than-normal benefits in the months or years before their Social Security  
benefits begin. In exchange, they would have to accept reduced pension benefits once the Social Security payments  
started.  
SOCIAL SECURITY FREEZE maintenance of Social Security benefits at current dollar or percentage levels. Social  
Security benefits are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and rise in tandem with the Index. A benefit freeze is one  
solution that legislators and regulators have proposed to cope with a troubled Social Security system, but many  
powerful lobbying groups oppose such a remedy.

according to a formula. Many pension plans "offset," or reduce, monthly pension benefits by a percentage of the  
employee's monthly Social Security benefit. See also PENSION PLAN INTEGRATION WITH SOCIAL SECURITY.  
SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES (SA) membership organization of individuals especially trained in the application of  
ACTUARIAL mathematics, including compound interest, annuities, life contingencies, measurement of mortality  
probability, and statistics. The organization holds a series of actuarial examinations for prospective members seeking  
the designation of Fellow or Associate of the Society of Actuaries (FSA, ASA).  
SOCIETY OF CHARTERED PROPERTY AND CASUALTY UNDERWRITERS membership organization of  
individuals especially trained in the application of property and casualty insurance to personal and business situations.  
Membership is achieved by passing a series of examinations administered by the American Institute for Property and  
Liability Underwriters, plus three years of industry experience. Successful completion of the examinations results in the  
designation of Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter (CPCU).  
SOCIETY OF INSURANCE RESEARCH organization formed to encourage research in insurance and to foster an  
exchange of ideas and research methodology among the society members.  
SOLE PROPRIETOR LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE coverage for the owner of a business. When a proprietor  
dies, debts of the business become the debts of the estate since in this circumstance the law recognizes business and  
personal assets as one. The executor is required to dispose of the business as quickly as possible. Life insurance can  
fund the disposition in several ways:  
1. If the business is transferred through a will, the life insurance's death benefit can be applied to the deceased  
proprietor's personal and business debts and estate taxes.  
2. If the executor conducts a forced sale or liquidation, a death benefit can be used to reduce or eliminate any debts. The  
death benefit can also be used as a source of working capital for interim financing to operate the business in the short  
run.  
3. If the business is to be transferred to a child or employee, the death benefit can provide funds to effect the transfer.  
4. If the business is to be sold to a key employee(s) through a buy-and-sell agreement, the key employee(s) usually has  
previously bought a life insurance policy on the sole proprietor and made all premium payments. The buy-and-sell  
agreement stipulates the formula to be used in valuing the business as well as other conditions of the sale. Upon the  
death of the proprietor and the sale of the business to the key employee(s), the proprietor's estate receives the

cash amount according to the buy-and-sell agreement, and the key employee(s) receives the deceased proprietor's  
business.  
SOLICITING AGENT see SOLICITOR (SOLICITING AGENT).  
SOLICITING OFFER see SOLICITOR (SOLICITING AGENT).  
SOLICITOR (SOLICITING AGENT) insurance salesperson who contacts potential customers and handles clerical  
responsibilities but has no authority to make insurance contracts. See also BINDER; GENERAL AGENT (GA).  
SOLIDITY SURPLUS additional amount of SURPLUS generated by an additional amount of capital to be included in  
the surplus above that required by the STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. This additional surplus is necessary in the  
event unforeseen contingencies occur. Such contingencies could impair the insurance company's ability to make future  
benefit payments for which it has received the premiums as well as to fund the growth of new sales.  
SOLVENCY minimum standard of financial health for an insurance company, where assets exceed liabilities. State  
laws require insurance regulators to step in when solvency of an insurer is threatened and proceed with rehabilitation or  
liquidation.  
SOLVENCY SURPLUS additional amount of SURPLUS generated by an additional amount of CAPITAL to be  
included in book value surplus. This additional surplus is necessary to act as a supplement to the STATUTORY  
RESERVES in the event unforeseen contingencies occur. Such contingencies could impair the insurance company's  
ability to make future benefit payments for which it has received the premiums.  
SONIC BOOM LOSSES property damage resulting from aircraft traveling faster than the speed of sound. Although the  
vibrations caused by such high speed can cause damage, it is excluded on most property forms.  
SOUND EQUIPMENT INSURANCE special endorsement to PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP) covering  
loss of records, tapes, and other sound equipment caused by an insured peril in an insured automobile.  
SOURCES OF INCOME in insurance, company revenues from underwriting and investment. Insurance companies  
make money first, by underwriting good risks so that their premium dollars cover claims losses and expenses (the  
money left over being called underwriting income), and second, by investing premium dollars until claims have to be  
paid (called investment income), sometimes many years later. In the late 1970s, for example, casualty insurers lost  
money on under-writing but made up for the loss with a gain in investment income.  
SOURCES OF SURPLUS cash carried forward from the previous year, plus gains from operations for the current year,  
plus any capital gains.

SOUTH-EASTERN UNDERWRITERS ASSOCIATION (SEUA) CASE important 1944 U.S. Supreme Court ruling  
that the insurance business constituted interstate commerce and was thus subject to the SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT.  
This decision came in U.S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, a price-fixing case, brought against a fire  
insurance rate-making group by the U.S. Attorney General, at the urging of the state of Missouri. SEUA relied for its  
defense on the 1869 PAUL V. VIRGINIA decision by the Supreme Court that insurance activities were not commerce  
and the Sherman Act did not apply. The high court subsequently accepted the argument that the industry was subject to  
the antitrust law. In response, Congress passed the MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT (PUBLIC LAW 15) in 1945, in  
effect overruling the court by stating affirmatively that regulation of insurance was the job of the states, not the federal  
government. The law exempted insurance from federal antitrust rules if it was covered by state regulation.  
SPECIAL ACCEPTANCE extension of a REINSURANCE treaty to include a risk that was not originally in its terms.  
SPECIAL AGENT individual who sells and services life insurance in an exclusive territory; in property and casualty  
insurance, an individual who represents a property and casualty insurance company as a marketing representative.  
SPECIAL BUILDING FORM endorsement to the SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP) policy that provides  
ALL RISKS damage coverage for real property. This special form provides only minimum cover, leaving the option for  
adding forms to the policyholder. The policyholder has a choice of the general building form, which provides named  
peril coverage, or the special building form for the broader all-risks coverage.  
SPECIAL CHARGE any fee imposed on insurance companies by a state. Insurers pay special taxes, including premium  
taxes and franchise taxes. In addition, various states have their own special charges to cover costs of such things as  
maintaining fire departments, licensing agents, or filing reports.  
SPECIAL DAMAGES see LIABILITY, CIVIL DAMAGES AWARDED.  
SPECIAL EXTENDED COVERAGE endorsement to a property insurance policy providing ALL RISKS coverage for  
insured property. Excluded properties include residences, farms, and manufacturing properties. This endorsement is  
generally used for property that does not qualify for a packaged form such as the standard multiperil policy.  
SPECIAL FEATURES see OPTIONAL BENEFITS.

SPECIAL MORTALITY TABLE one used to determine the life expectancy of ANNUITANTS. Annuity buyers are not  
representative of  
< previous page page_473 next page >  
 
< previous page page_474 next page >  
Page 474  
the population as a whole, or of life insurance buyers. Because annuities pay an income for life, only those in good  
health, and who expect to live a long time, will spend their money for an annuity contract. Recognizing this, life  
insurers, who sell annuity contracts, use special mortality tables, which chiefly consider age and sex, to predict their  
deaths. For example, if a 50-year-old applicant purchases an IMMEDIATE ANNUITY for life with $100,000, the  
income would be less than that for a 70-year-old. Likewise, because women have longer life expectancies, their monthly  
income payments would be lower than men of the same age.  
SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP) coverage usually provided for large businesses in four areas:  
1. Section I (Property)The building(s) and contents are covered against either any peril (ALL RISKS basis) or only  
perils listed in Section I. It is to the advantage of the business to have coverage written on an ALL RISKS basis.  
Endorsements can be added for sprinkler leakage, business interruption, extra expense, water damage, rental loss,  
valuable records and papers, mercantile robbery and safe burglary, mercantile open stock burglary, glass and fine arts,  
or these items can be covered separately.  
2. Section II (Liability)The insured is covered for actions or nonactions that result in liability exposure arising out of  
ownership, use, possession and/or maintenance of the covered locations and structures. Also covered are the business's  
activities conducted by the insured whether at or from the covered locations and structures. Endorsements can be added  
to cover for medical payments, liability arising out of products and completed operations, and liability arising out of  
operation of a nonowned automobile. Additional endorsements can be added to this section to broaden liability coverage.  
3. Section III (Crime)Coverage for employee dishonesty, premises loss both inside and outside of the structure, forgery  
by depositions, paper currency that proves to be counterfeit, and money orders. The comprehensive DISHONESTY,  
DISAPPEARANCE, AND DESTRUCTION POLICY (3-D POLICY) and the BLANKET CRIME POLICY provide  
these coverages.  
4. Section IV (Boiler and Machinery)Coverage for explosion of a boiler, engine, turbines, and/or pipes owned or under  
the control of the insured. Endorsements can be added to cover indirect and consequential losses resulting from  
accidents associated with the boiler and machinery expenses. The SMP has generally been replaced by the  
COMMERCIAL PACKAGE POLICY.  
SPECIAL PERSONAL PROPERTY FORM endorsement to the SPECIAL MULTIPERIL INSURANCE (SMP) policy  
that provides ALL RISKS damage coverage for personal property. There are special limitations on amounts of coverage  
for furs, jewelry, precious stones and metals, patterns and  
< previous page page_474 next page >  
 
< previous page page_475 next page >  
Page 475  
dies, and stamps, tickets, and letters of credit. Certain electronic equipment and fragile materials are only covered for  
specific perils.  
SPECIAL RISK INSURANCE transfer of highly individualized loss exposures that is not based on the usual pooling  
principles of insurance such as risk identification and classification selection. Rather than setting up an insurance pool  
of standard risks, the underwriter accepts responsibility for a unique or special risk. Some examples would be insurance  
by LLOYD'S OF LONDON underwriters for athletes, artists, and entertainers; insurance on Betty Grable's legs; or  
insurance for dangerous scientific experiments or moon travel.  
SPECIFIC COVERAGE see SPECIFIC INSURANCE.  
SPECIFIC EXCESS CONTRACT policy in which an insurer agrees to pay property or liability losses in excess of a  
specific amount per occurrence. For example, this type of coverage typically is used by an employer that self insures its  
workers compensation but wants to limit the loss per accident to, say, $40,000. Contrasts with stop loss aggregate  
contract that pays for total losses above a certain amount during the year.  
SPECIFIC EXCESS REINSURANCE EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE written on a FACULTATIVE  
REINSURANCE basis to provide cover for a particular PRIMARY INSURANCE policy.  
SPECIFIC INSURANCE single insurance policy for only one kind of property at only one location of an insured. For  
example, property insurance on a rare piano in the insured's home would cover only that piano, not any other property  
of the insured.  
SPECIFIC LIMIT maximum limit of LIABILITY of an insurance company for a particular claim or kind of loss that is  
applicable in general to all such claims or losses. This maximum limit of liability is usually less than the POLICY  
LIMIT of liability.  
SPECIFIC RATE property insurance premium rate that is applicable to a single, particular piece of property.  
SPECIFIC REINSURANCE see FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE.  
SPECIFIC STOP LOSS INSURANCE coverage that goes into effect when an individual's claim reaches a specific  
threshold selected by the employer who has SELF-INSURANCE. After this threshold is reached, the policy pays claims  
up to the health insurance's lifetime limit per employee.  
SPECIFIED DISEASE POLICY see DREAD DISEASE INSURANCE.  
SPECIFIED PERIL INSURANCE policy covering loss only for a named peril in the policy. For example, the Standard  
Fire Policy covers only the two named perils of fire and lightning. Other perils can be added by endorsement, such as  
theft, vandalism, malicious mischief, and burglary.

Page 476  
SPECULATIVE see SPECULATIVE RISK.  
SPECULATIVE RISK uncertain prospect of financial gain or loss. A business investment that could either return a  
profit or sustain a loss, such as the purchase of a common stock, is an example of a speculative risk. In most instances,  
speculative risks are not insurable. See also PURE RISK; STANDARD RISK.  
SPELL OF ILLNESS period of time an insured is sick and entitled to receive health insurance benefits. See also  
DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE, GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE.  
SPENDTHRIFT TRUST see SPENDTHRIFT TRUST CLAUSE.  
SPENDTHRIFT TRUST CLAUSE provision in a life insurance policy that protects its proceeds from the beneficiary's  
creditors. On payment, the beneficiary loses the protection of the spendthrift trust clause and the beneficiary's creditors  
can then bring suit to attach the proceeds.  
SPINOUT method of terminating a SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE policy in which the company transfers its  
interest in the life insurance policy to the insured employee. Through such a transfer, the insured employee incurs a tax  
liability on the policy's transferred value.  
SPLIT ANNUITY division of a sum of money between a DEFERRED ANNUITY and an immediate LIFE ANNUITY  
CERTAIN.  
SPLIT DEDUCTIBLE deductible applicable to each loss so that the amount of each loss retained by the insured varies  
according to the PERIL that caused the loss. For example, the split deductible in a policy may specify that the insured  
must retain the first $300 of any fire loss and $100 of any vandalism and malicious mischief loss.  
SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE policy in which premiums, ownership rights, and death proceeds are split  
between an employer and an employee, or between a parent and a child. The employer pays the part of each year's  
premium that at least equals the increase in the cash value. The employee may pay the remainder of the premium, or the  
employer may pay the entire premium. When the increase in cash value equals or exceeds the yearly premium, the  
employer pays the entire premium. If the employee dies while in the service of the employer, a beneficiary chosen by  
the employee receives the difference between the face value and the amount paid to the employer (the cash value or the  
total of all premiums paid by the employer whichever is greater). Thus, during employment, the employee's share of the  
death benefit decreases. If the employee leaves the employer, the latter has the option of surrendering the policy in  
exchange for return of all premiums, or selling the policy to the employee for the amount of its cash value. There are  
two types of split dollar life insurance policies: (1) Endorsementthe employer owns all policy privileges; the employee's  
only rights are to choose beneficiaries and to select the manner in which the death benefit is paid. (2) Collateral  
< previous page page_476 next page >  
 
< previous page page_477 next page >  
Page 477  
the employee owns the policy. The employer's contributions toward the premiums are viewed as a series of interest-free  
loans, which equal the yearly increase in the cash value of the policy. The employee assigns the policy to the employer  
as collateral for these loans. When the employee dies, the loans are paid from the face value of the policy. Any  
remaining proceeds are paid to the beneficiary.  
SPLIT FUNDED PLAN retirement arrangement in which contributions are divided between allocated (insured) and  
unallocated funding instruments (an uninsured plan). It seeks to combine the advantages of guarantees-of-income of the  
allocated funding instrument with the investment flexibility (and possible higher yields) of an unallocated funding  
instrument. For example, 60% of contributions could be placed in a RETIREMENT INCOME POLICY (or other  
permanent life insurance policy) and 40% in a DEPOSIT ADMINISTRATION PLAN (or other fund held and invested  
by a trustee).  
SPLIT FUNDING see SPLIT FUNDED PLAN.  
SPLIT LIFE INSURANCE combination life insurance policy composed of TERM LIFE INSURANCE and an  
INSTALLMENT REFUND ANNUITY.  
SPLIT LIMIT see SPLIT LIMITS COVERAGE.  
SPLIT LIMITS COVERAGE technique for expressing limits of liability coverage under a particular insurance policy,  
stating separate limits for different types of claims growing out of a single event or combination of events. Coverage  
may be split (limited) per person, per occurrence, between bodily injury and property damage, or in other ways.  
Property damage liability is listed with a limit per accident. For example, a policy with split limits quoted as $100,000/  
$300,000/ $25,000 would provide a maximum of $100,000 bodily injury coverage per person, $300,000 total bodily  
injury coverage per accident, and $25,000 total property damage liability coverage per accident.  
SPOUSAL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT established  
under the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986, for a spouse who has unearned income. The maximum annual combined  
contribution into the worker's and spouse's IRA is $2250. The contributions can be apportioned between the two  
accounts in any manner desired.  
SPOUSE'S BENEFIT insured sum paid regularly to a married partner (usually a wife but sometimes a husband) of a  
retired worker. There are several forms:  
1. The Federal Retirement Equity Act mandates a spouse's benefit payable out of a husband's pension, unless cancelled  
under specified conditions.  
2. Under Social Security, a spouse receives a benefit upon reaching age 65, whether or not that person has earned Social  
Security credits.  
3. Some business firms provide for a spouse's benefit at the death of  
< previous page page_477 next page >  
 
< previous page page_478 next page >  
Page 478  
a retired worker, usually a percentage of the deceased worker's last highest salary, funded out of the deceased's pension.  
4. A joint and survivor annuity can provide a spouse's benefit. For example, a joint and two-thirds annuity gives the  
couple an income for as long as both are alive, and when one dies the survivor receives two-thirds of the amount they  
had been getting.

SPREAD ON INTEREST-BEARING FUNDS difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interestbearing  
liabilities.  
SPREADSHEET risk management tool to determine risk exposure and to help spread the risk. A risk manager considers  
a business firm's individual exposures separately. As the number of exposures increases, the threat that all units will  
suffer loss decreases, and the manager is able to spread the risk.  
SPRINKLER DAMAGE INSURANCE see SPRINKLER LEAKAGE INSURANCE; SPRINKLER LEAKAGE  
LEGAL LIABILITY INSURANCE.  
SPRINKLER LEAKAGE INSURANCE coverage for property damage caused by untimely discharge from an  
automatic sprinkler system. This coverage, available through an endorsement to the Standard Fire Policy, typically  
excludes losses from fire, lightning, windstorm, earthquake, explosion, rupture of steam boiler, riot, civil commotion,  
and order of civil authority.  
SPRINKLER LEAKAGE LEGAL LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for liability for damage to property of others  
from untimely discharge of fire-fighting sprinkler systems. This coverage is available as an endorsement to broad-form  
COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE (CGL).  
SPRINKLING TRUST trust in which the TRUSTEE distributes capital and income to the beneficiaries of the trust  
according to their economic needs.  
STACKING circumstance under which the insured maintains that, if an insurance policy covers at least two scheduled  
items of real or personal property, in the event of a loss applicable coverage should be twice the stated limit in the  
policy. In an effort to avoid the stacking issue, automobile policies include a stipulation that the limit of liability stated  
in the DECLARATIONS SECTION is the maximum amount the INSURER will pay for all damages resulting from one  
accident, regardless of the number of insureds, claims made, vehicles, or premiums stated in the declarations section, or  
vehicles involved in an accident.

who are salaried by the HMO. These physicians treat solely HMO members who are covered only if they use HMO  
physicians and hospitals.  
STAFF UNDERWRITER see UNDERWRITER, LAY.  
STAMP AND COIN COLLECTIONS INSURANCE coverage on an ALL RISKS basis at any location for stamp and  
coin collections, excluding wear and tear, war, nuclear disaster, and mysterious disappearance. Usually each item is  
specifically listed and valued in the policy. This insurance is of particular importance for insureds with valuable stamp  
and coin collections. Standard property insurance policies such as the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY have a  
relatively low limit of coverage of specialty items such as stamp and coin collections.  
STAMP AND COIN DEALERS INSURANCE coverage on an ALL RISKS basis, subject to exclusions of war, wear  
and tear, loss resulting from delay, loss of market, infidelity of the insured's employee, loss due to rain, sleet, snow, or  
flood, except while the stamps or coins are in transit. This is a special INLAND MARINE insurance coverage designed  
specifically for dealers.  
STANDARD method of UNDERWRITING insurance in which the INSURANCE COMPANY utilizes regular  
MORTALITY TABLES without additions for abnormalities.

computed as the arithmetic mean of the differences between each outcome and the average of all outcomes in the set.  
STANDARD FIRE POLICY see FIRE INSURANCESTANDARD FIRE POLICY.  
STANDARD FIRE POLICY ANALYSIS method of rating that compares property to be insured to a standard and  
adjusts the rate for deviations from the standard. A standard building is situated in a standard city of specific  
construction with specified fire protection. Other risks are compared to the standard and given credits or debits if they  
are a better or worse risk.  
STANDARD FORM approved or accepted policy for a particular type of risk. The only type of risk covered by a  
standard form mandated by  
< previous page page_479 next page >  
 
< previous page page_480 next page >  
Page 480  
law is the fire policy. In 1886, New York adopted a standard fire form that has since been revised and adopted by every  
other state. In other types of coverage, states may prescribe mandatory or optional minimums or may forbid certain  
provisions. Therefore, while life and health benefits may vary widely, for example, policyholders are given certain  
uniform rights like grace periods for paying premiums. In other areas, insurers have voluntarily adopted standard forms.  
One example is the standard automobile policy. Other types of coverage are offered on standard forms developed by  
rating bureaus such as the INSURANCE SERVICES OFFICE (ISO). Although insurers may use these forms, they are  
not obligated to do so, and many develop their own forms.

can be provided, if the insurance company desires. Standard provisions include the BENEFICIARY; GRACE PERIOD;  
INCONTESTABLE CLAUSE; NONFORFEITURE (CASH SURRENDER BENEFIT, REDUCED PAID-UP  
BENEFIT, EXTENDED TERM BENEFIT); POLICY LOAN; REINSTATEMENT; SUICIDE CLAUSE; WAR

STANDBY TRUSTS trusts in which individuals manage their own assets and only if a predetermined event occurs,  
such as incapacity, will another party take over the management of these assets. Upon recovering from the incapacity,  
the individual may resume the management of the assets.  
STANDING TIMBER INSURANCE coverage against only two perils, fire and lightning. The amount of coverage is  
per acre of standing timber for either merchantable trees (living trees with no decay, and minimum diameter), or for  
trees used in reforestation. This coverage is commonly purchased by tree farmers and investors. Historically, because of  
tax write-offs, investing in tree farms has been particularly popular among certain investors. With the passage of the  
TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986 such a tax shelter is no longer possible, but the reason for purchasing timber insurance  
for protection remains unchanged.  
STARE DECISIS Latin phrase meaning ''to stand by the decisions." This legal doctrine under common law requires  
courts to rely on precedents, or previous decisions, when deciding disputes unless there is a compelling reason to reject  
those precedents. In most instances, this doctrine means that courts will decide disputes over insurance contracts the  
same way they have decided cases with similar facts and legal issues in the past.

STATED AMOUNT ENDORSEMENT addition to a property policy providing coverage for a specified amount. This  
endorsement is typically used for an unusual or valuable piece of property that does not fit standard descriptions and,  
instead of declining, retains its value. For example, a classic Austin Healey 3000 Mark IV might be covered by this type  
of endorsement to a PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY (PAP).

STATE EXEMPTION STATUTE laws in most cases protecting life insurance policies from an insured's creditors.  
These laws typically exempt death benefit proceeds and policy cash values from attachment by creditors, particularly if  
the beneficiary is a spouse or child of the insured. Many exemption laws have limits, with all insurance proceeds over a  
certain amount, say $20,000, available to the insured's creditors.

In some states, endowment and ANNUITY policies are granted less protection from creditors than ORDINARY LIFE  
INSURANCE because such policies are often used as investment vehicles. See also LIFE INSURANCE, CREDITOR  
RIGHTS.  
STATE FUND account established and administered by a state agency to finance a mandatory insurance program, for  
example, WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE.  
STATE GOVERNMENT INSURANCE health insurance coverage offered by some states for medical expenses and  
loss of income from nonoccupational disability. The merits of federal health insurance have been debated for some time.  
In the meantime, several states have passed plans that may be used as a testing ground for a more comprehensive plan.  
For example, Rhode Island pays for out-of-pocket expenses that total more than $5000 or a certain percentage of  
income. Other states have passed similar laws, including Georgia, Maine, Minnesota, and Connecticut.  
STATE HIGH RISK POOLS FOR THE MEDICALLY UNINSURABLE state plans that provide health insurance  
coverage for those who are unable to purchase medical insurance. Coverage is provided by a specially formed nonprofitmaking  
pool comprised of all the health insurance companies doing business in that particular state. The pool offers the  
insurance coverage to those residents of the state who: (1) have been rejected for health insurance coverage by at least  
one insurance company; and/or (2) have higher premium payments for a currently insured plan than that required by the  
pool; and/or (3) have insurance under a rated health insurance policy or have a restrictive rider attached to that policy.  
The typical lifetime maximum benefits in most states is $500,000 with a $500 DEDUCTIBLE. The waiting period in  
most states is usually six months if the applicant has been treated for a medical problem within six months of the  
application. Generally, in most states the premium paid by the insured ranges from 125% to 150% of the standard  
premium rate for that of an individual health insurance policy purchased through a standard carrier.

public accountant indicating if a company's financial statements fairly present its true financial condition. A statement  
of opinion may be unqualified, qualified, or adverse. An unqualified, or "clean," opinion indicates no exceptions or  
qualifications were found by the auditor. A qualified report means the statement makes a fair presentation of a firm's  
financial condition except for some important uncertainties with effects that cannot be determined by the auditor. In the  
case of an insurance company, an example of an important uncertainty that might lead to a qualified opinion would be  
the outcome of litigation over a major disputed claim. An adverse opinion means the auditor is unwilling to vouch for  
the financial statements presented by the company.  
STATE MUTUAL assessment mutual company that operates on a statewide basis or in more than one state. See also  
ASSESSABLE MUTUAL.  
STATE-OF-THE-ART DEFENSE provision established either by state statute or court order that permits the defendant  
to establish that at the time of the injury incurred by the plaintiff, the defendant provided goods and services in  
accordance with the state of technological and scientific knowledge as of the date and/or was in compliance with  
industry or government standards at that time.  
STATE RATE standard property/casualty insurance premium set by a state rating bureau. States have responsibility for  
regulating insurers and making certain that rates are reasonable. To this end, experience information is gathered by  
rating bureaus, and standard (or advisory) rates are set for various lines of insurance in that state. The rates are simply  
for guidance and individual companies may charge more or less as long as their rates are approved by the state  
commissioner. The bureau may represent the companies that write a particular line of insurance in that state, such as  
workers compensation, and may request rate increases from the state commissioner on behalf of its members.  
STATE RATE SHEET see STATE RATE.  
STATE SAVINGS GUARANTEE CORPORATION state-sponsored insurance fund that was intended to guarantee  
deposits at state-chartered savings institutions. A handful of these funds existed in the early 1980s, but after a string of  
savings and loan failures in Maryland and Ohio in 1985, these funds were phased out and the member savings  
institutions converted to Federal Deposit Insurance.  
STATE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION primary responsibility for overseeing the insurance industry that has  
rested with individual

Page 484  
states since 1945, after Congress passed the MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT (PUBLIC LAW 15). In addition to  
supervision and regulation, states receive taxes and fees paid by the industry that amount to several billion dollars a  
year. State insurance laws are administered by state insurance departments that are responsible for making certain that  
(1) rates are adequate, not unfairly discriminatory, and not unreasonably high, and (2) insurance companies in the state  
are financially sound and able to pay future claims.  
To this end, states set requirements for company reserves, require annual financial statements, and examine company  
books. Each state has an insurance commissioner or superintendent who is either elected or appointed by the governor,  
with responsibility for investigating company practices, approving rates and policy forms, and ordering liquidation of  
insolvent insurers. The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) has drafted model  
legislation and worked for policy uniformity, but regulations vary widely from state to state.  
Whether insurers should be regulated by the states or the federal government remains at issue, but so far insurers and the  
NAIC lobbying have been effective in resisting federal regulation. Nevertheless, the federal government has a profound  
effect on the insurance industry through its taxes and a variety of regulations. See also STATE TAXATION OF  
INSURANCE.  
STATE TAXATION OF INSURANCE authority of states to tax the insurance companies they regulate. States levy  
income taxes, real and personal property taxes, and special levies, the most important of which is a premium taxin  
effect, a sales tax on premiums. Although it is generally 2% of premiums, some states tax as much as 4%. Insurers also  
pay franchise taxes, licensing fees, and SPECIAL CHARGES. Insurance taxes are an important source of revenue for  
the states, amounting to several billion dollars a year. See also FEDERAL TAXATION.  
STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE see UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.  
STATIC TABLE MORTALITY TABLE, MORBIDITY TABLE that does not include current statistical experience.  
STATIC RISK damage or destruction of property and/or property that is illegally transferred as the result of misconduct  
of individuals. The risk is insurable.  
STATISTICS collection of numbers to record and analyze data such as occurrences of events and particular  
characteristics. Statistics are absolutely vital to all elements of insurance. In life and health insurance, they are used to  
tabulate age, sex, disability, cause of death, occupation, and other data needed to construct a MORBIDITY TABLE and  
MORTALITY TABLE, which in turn figure importantly in calculating premiums. Similarly, in property and casualty  
insurance statistics are  
< previous page page_484 next page >  
 
< previous page page_485 next page >  
Page 485  
used to record losses and injuries to help predict their future occurrence in order to calculate premiums.  
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS period, set by law, after which a damage claim cannot be made. Limits are set by  
individual states and usually range from one to seven years.  
STATUTORY ACCOUNTING rules that insurance companies must follow in filing an annual financial statement  
known as the convention blank, with state insurance departments. The reported financial condition of an insurance  
company can differ markedly depending on whether statutory accounting rules or GENERALLY ACCEPTED  
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) are used in preparing financial statements. In general, statutory accounting is  
more conservative than GAAP because it tends to overstate expenses and liabilities while understating income and  
assets.  
STATUTORY BONDS any of a number of types of SURETY BONDS that the law requires of government contractors,  
licensed businesses, litigants, fiduciaries, government officials, and others whose performance of some duty or  
obligation must be assured in the public interest. See also APPEAL BOND; BAIL BOND; BID BOND;  
COMPLETION BOND; CONTRACT BOND; FEDERAL OFFICIALS BOND; JUDICIAL BOND; LICENSE BOND;  
LOST INSTRUMENT BOND; PENSION PLANS PERFORMANCE BOND; PERMIT BOND; SECURITIES BOND;  
TRUSTEE ROLE.  
STATUTORY EARNINGS revenue based on conservative reserve requirements of various states. Statutory earnings do  
not meet GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). A role of state regulation is to make  
certain that insurers have enough money set aside in STATUTORY RESERVES to pay all future claims and that the  
company will remain solvent. For this reason, regulators take a conservative approach to setting reserve requirements.  
But because an increase in reserves translates into lower earnings for a stock insurer, investors, and securities analysts  
argue that they are not helpful in gauging the health of a company for investment purposes. Therefore, insurers calculate  
statutory earnings for regulators and another set of earnings, based on natural reserves, for investors.

STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS standards set by the various state regulatory authorities that determine how financial  
statements must be prepared for regulators. The states are responsible for making certain that insurers will remain  
solvent and have enough set aside in reserves to pay future claims. To this end, they have devised STATUTORY  
ACCOUNTING principles that govern insurance company reporting. These requirements differ from GENERALLY  
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). Among other things, statutory requirements include the setting of  
STATUTORY RESERVES, and the immediate expensing of the cost of acquiring new business, rather than allowing  
insurers to spread the exposure over the life of the policy. See also STATE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.  
STATUTORY RESERVES reserves required by state regulators. Because regulators must assure that an insurance  
company remains solvent and that it can pay future claims, they set conservative standards for insurer reserves.  
Regulators have various formulas for valuing reserves, such as the LOSS FREQUENCY METHOD and the  
Commissioners Reserve Valuation Method.  
STATUTORY RESTRICTION limitation imposed on insurance companies by state law. States oversee the insurance  
industry, being responsible for making certain that the rates are fair, reasonable, and adequate, and that among other  
things, the companies that write insurance in the state are financially sound and able to pay future claims. To this end,  
the states restrict the types of investments insurance companies can make with their premium dollars, and they control  
insurers' relationships with insureds by guaranteeing certain minimum rights to insureds.  
STATUTORY STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE (SSAP) 16EDP EQUIPMENT state law that limits the  
admitted value of an insurance company's EDP equipment to 3% of the company's ADJUSTED SURPLUS.

contractual reimbursements to the insurance company be reflected as a reduction in PAID LOSSES.  
STATUTORY STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE (SSAP) 68BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND

stipulates that the worth of separate accounts must be valued at current market with the exception of those separate  
accounts established and maintained for GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (GICS).  
STATUTORY SURPLUS excess funds above the amount required to establish LEGAL RESERVES for the policies in  
force. These excess funds are generated as the result of mortality savings, excess interest earned on investments (an  
amount above that expected), and expense savings.

STIPULATED PREMIUM COMPANY see STIPULATED PREMIUM INSURANCE.  
STIPULATED PREMIUM INSURANCE a form of ASSESSMENT INSURANCE for which a regular premium is  
charged. In addition to paying the regular stipulated premium, an insured and other members of a mutual  
ASSESSMENT COMPANY may be subject to an additional assessment premium to make up for underwriting losses.  
STOCK see STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY.  
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARs) contractual rights to a stipulated percentage of the increase in the value of  
an insurance agency over a given future period of time. They are used to convey a percentage of the increase in the  
agency's value to a key employee without resulting in the owner(s) of the agency owning less than 50%. The advantages  
of such a stock transfer for the agency owner include the following:  
1. Noncompete agreements not further reinforced since the key employee does not receive benefits if an agreement is  
violated.  
2. The key employee is tied to the agency because that employee can become an equity owner without actually  
committing his or her own funds.  
These SARs are really long-term deferred compensation plans for the employee(s) whose ultimate value is tied to the  
increase in the value of the agency's book of business over the value at the time  
< previous page page_487 next page >

the right was granted to the employee(s). This circumstance should increase the commitment of the employee(s) to  
increase the economic value of the agency.  
STOCK COMPANY INSURANCE insurance sold by a stock insurance company that is usually in the form of  
NONPARTICIPATING INSURANCE.  
STOCKING A MUTUAL see DEMUTUALIZATION (STOCKING A MUTUAL).  
STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY business owned by stockholders, as contrasted to a MUTUAL INSURANCE  
COMPANY, which is owned by its policyholders. Many major life insurers are mutual companies whereas some  
leading property/casualty and multiline insurers are stock insurance companies. See also DEMUTUALIZATION  
(STOCKING A MUTUAL).  
STOCK INSURER see STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY.  
STOCK PROCESSING INSURANCE coverage in the event that stock sent to others for processing is damaged or  
destroyed en route or at their premises except those perils specifically excluded. For example, this coverage can be used  
when processing milk into cheese since the farmer would lose everything if the milk were damaged or destroyed en  
route or at the processor's premises.  
STOCK REDEMPTION PLAN see CLOSE CORPORATION PLAN.  
STOCK SWAP trading of stock to enhance portfolio performance and reduce taxes. This practice is followed when the  
investor has accumulated losses on stocks and sells these stocks in order to use the losses to offset capital gains on other  
investments, thereby reducing taxable income. Losses incurred in this manner can be used to offset capital gains dollarfor- 
dollar. For any additional losses, they can be used to offset ordinary income of up to $3000. All excess losses can be  
carried forward to future years.  
STOCK TRANSFER reregistration of existing shares when there is any change in the name of the owner(s). Such a  
circumstance may occur when the owner(s) of the shares gives these shares to another person, establishes a trust,  
marries and changes the name, or adds or removes a name as owner. The transfer is executed through a letter of  
instruction with the signature of all owners guaranteed by a bank or a broker and sent to the transfer agent.  
STOP LOSS see STOP LOSS REINSURANCE.  
STOP LOSS AGGREGATE CONTRACT see STOP LOSS REINSURANCE.  
STOP LOSS INSURANCE coverage purchased by employers in order to limit their exposure under SELF  
INSURANCE medical plans. This coverage is available in two types:  
1. Specific stop lossCoverage is initiated when a claim reaches the threshold selected by the employer. After the  
threshold is reached, the stop-loss policy would pay claims up to the lifetime limit per employee for the self insurance  
medical plan.  
< previous page page_488 next page >  
 
< previous page page_489 next page >  
Page 489  
2. Aggregate stop lossCoverage is initiated when the employer's self insurance total group health claims reach a  
stipulated threshold selected by the employer. Typically, this threshold is 125% of the self insurer's annual estimated  
group health claims cost.  
STOP LOSS PROVISION see STOP LOSS REINSURANCE.  
STOP LOSS REINSURANCE protects a cedent against an aggregate amount of claims over a period, in excess of a  
specified percentage of the earned premium income. Stop loss reinsurance does not cover individual claims. The  
reinsurer's liability is limited to a stipulated percentage of the loss and/or a maximum dollar amount. The stop loss  
method protects the cedent against the possibility that the aggregate value of an accumulation of small losses will  
exceed a specified percentage of earned premium income of a particular class. Stop loss reinsurance is the exact  
opposite of the QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE and SURPLUS REINSURANCE, and differs considerably from  
other forms of EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE. For example, a reinsurer can provide a cedent with 50% of the  
amount by which aggregate incurred losses of the cedent in any year exceed 70% of the cedent's earned premium  
income during that year.  
STOREKEEPERS BURGLARY AND ROBBERY INSURANCE coverage for small mercantile establishments on a  
package basis. Combines six layers of protection: burglary of a safe; damage caused by robbery and burglary, whether  
actual or attempted; robbery of a guard and burglary of the business's merchandise; robbery inside or outside the  
premises of the business; kidnapping to physically force a businessowner and/or his or her representative(s) to open the  
premises of the business from the outside; and theft of securities and monies either from the home of a messenger of the  
business and/or from a night depository of a bank.  
STOREKEEPERS LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability resulting from  
ownership, use, and/or maintenance of the insured business's premises, completed operations, and products. Covers  
medical payment expenses associated with bodily injury to another party when an accident causes hazardous conditions  
on the business's premises or within the business's operation. Also covers costs in defending the insured against liability  
suits, even if the suits are without foundation.  
STORM INSURANCE (WINDSTORM INSURANCE) additional coverage to a property policy. Windstorms are not  
one of the standard covered perils. If an insured desires coverage for windstorms and hail, an endorsement is required.  
STRAIGHT DEDUCTIBLE CLAUSE section of a policy that specifies the dollar amount or percentage of any loss that  
the insurance does not pay. Most property and medical policies specify that the first portion of any loss is absorbed by  
the insured. A straight deductible  
< previous page page_489 next page >  
 
< previous page page_490 next page >  
Page 490  
clause, which is common in auto and homeowners insurance, might provide for a deductible stated in a dollar amount,  
such as $500. For example, the Smiths have a homeowners policy with a $500 straight deductible clause. Fire damage  
to the home amounts to $1500. Under the terms of the policy, the Smiths would pay the first $500 and the insurance  
company would reimburse them for $1000. Some straight deductibles are expressed as a specific percentage of value  
rather than a dollar amount. For example, the insured might absorb the loss for 5% of the value of property that is totally  
destroyed. See also DISAPPEARING DEDUCTIBLE.  
STRAIGHT LIFE ANNUITY see ANNUITY; ANNUITY DUE; LIFE ANNUITY CERTAIN; PURE ANNUITY;  
REFUND ANNUITY.  
STRAIGHT LIFE INSURANCE see ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE.  
STRAIGHT LINE RULE method of depreciating an asset in which its useful life is divided into an appropriate number  
of years (or other periods), the final salvage value is deducted, and the asset is written off in an equal portion for each  
period. Depreciation is a business expense for tax purposes. Straight line depreciation is the simplest method, but is not  
as advantageous to an owner as ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION, which allows a company to recover its costs more  
quickly.  
STRATEGIC RISK FINANCING elimination of unnecessary financing costs and the redirection of those sums to  
activities that are more profitable. The concept is for the company to have a long-term view of its risk exposure as  
opposed to concentrating on the availability of insurance at any time. For example, in a soft market, companies tend to  
buy more insurance than they need because premiums are low. In a hard market, companies tend to retain their  
insurance coverage regardless of price. The methodology involves a cost/benefit analysis of the numerous risk retention  
options to discern the difference in the cost of a retention option and that of full/partial insurance for that option. In the  
analysis of each option, the company's past loss experience is examined and maximum possible loss scenarios in the  
future are projected. After the statistical studies are completed, a program is designed to provide an effective plan of risk  
coverage at an efficient price.  
STRATIFICATION OF LOSSES technique of breaking down the various losses as a whole into useful components  
called subsets (strata) so that no subset is overrepresented. The result is the classification of losses according to dollar  
amount in order to predict the probabilities of various degrees of loss severity so that the organization can adopt the  
proper RISK MANAGEMENT techniques. See also RATE MAKING.  
STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING selection of restricted random samples in order to obtain a more accurate  
estimate of the EXPECTED LOSS (mean) than could be obtained by the selection of completely  
< previous page page_490 next page >  
 
< previous page page_491 next page >  
Page 491  
RANDOM SAMPLES. For example, assume it is the desire to obtain an accurate estimate of the average number of  
automobile accidents experienced by juniors in the Louisiana State University System. By selecting the proper size of  
random samples among the various colleges within the system, a more accurate estimate of the number of automobile  
accidents experienced by juniors system-wide can be obtained than by selecting the same total random sample from the  
system as a whole.  
STREET CLOCK FLOATER endorsement to a scheduled property floater that provides ALL RISKS protection for  
street clocks. Clocks and signs attached to business property can be covered under the Standard Fire Policy. But a street  
clock floater provides broader coverage and protects the owner of the clock both in transit and wherever it is located.  
Each clock and its value must be listed on the schedule.  
STRICT LIABILITY tort liability, which is defined by law, requiring an injured party to prove only that he or she was  
harmed in a specified way in order to collect damages. For example, the law provides that an employer is responsible if  
a worker is injured on the job. All the worker must do to collect WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS is to prove  
that the injury took place at work. See also ABSOLUTE LIABILITY.  
STRIKE INSURANCE coverage to protect employers from losses due to labor disruptions. The ocean marine policy  
exempts losses caused by strikes, riots, and civil commotion. Special coverage is necessary.  
STRIKES, RIOTS, AND CIVIL COMMOTION CLAUSE exemption in ocean marine policy for losses caused by  
strikes, riots, and civil commotion. See also RIOT AND CIVIL COMMOTION INSURANCE, RIOT EXCLUSION;  
STRIKE INSURANCE.  
STRIKE-THROUGH CLAUSE (CUT-THROUGH CLAUSE) provision that holds a reinsurer liable for its share of  
losses even if the CEDING COMPANY becomes insolvent before paying these losses. For example, XYZ Insurance  
Co. writes a fire policy for Acme Manufacturing and then reinsures 80% of the risk with ABC Reinsurance. XYZ is  
declared insolvent. Then Acme Manufacturing burns to the ground. ABC Reinsurance would be responsible for the 80%  
of the risk it reinsured and would pay the claim directly to Acme.  
STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT periodic payments to an injured person or survivor for a determinable number of years  
or for life typically in settlement of a claim under a liability policy. Terms may include immediate reimbursement for  
medical and legal expenses and rehabilitation, and long-term payments for loss of income or as compensation for other  
injuries. A structured settlement can be expected to be less costly to the insurance carrier than a LUMP SUM settlement,  
especially if it enables costly litigation to be avoided.

Page 492  
STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT ANNUITY SINGLE PREMIUM IMMEDIATE ANNUITY purchased to fund a  
STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT. This product is purchased when the injured party (the plaintiff) wishes to have a  
monthly income payment for life and the insurance company (the liability insurance company providing coverage for  
the defendant) wishes to minimize the sum required to be paid to the plaintiff.

SUBROGATION see SUBROGATION CLAUSE.  
SUBROGATION CLAUSE section of PROPERTY INSURANCE and LIABILITY INSURANCE policies giving an  
insurer the right to take legal action against a third party responsible for a loss to an insured for which a claim has been  
paid. For example, an insurance company pays a claim for $40,000 in damages to an insured storekeeper for losses  
caused by a negligent contractor working next door. The policy's subrogation clause gives the insurer the right to be  
subrogated to, or take on as its own, the storekeeper's claim and to sue the contractor for damages.  
SUBROGATION PRINCIPLE surrender of rights by an insured against the third party to an insurance company that  
has paid a claim.  
SUBROGATION, PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE circumstance where an insurance company takes the  
place of an insured in bringing a liability suit against a third party who caused injury to the insured. For example, if a  
third party, through negligence, damages an insured's car and the insured's insurance company pays to restore the car,  
the insurance company has recourse against the third party for the costs involved. The insured cannot sue the third party  
for damage, since if successful, the insured could collect twice for the same damage.

SUBSTANDARD HEALTH INSURANCE (QUALIFIED IMPAIRMENT INSURANCE) coverage for persons whose  
medical history includes serious illness such as heart disease or whose physical condition is such that they are rated  
below standard. A policy may specifically deny coverage for recurrence of a particular illness or medical condition  
through an impairment exemption rider, or may provide only partial benefits. See also RATED POLICY.  
SUBSTANDARD LIFE INSURANCE coverage for risks deemed uninsurable at standard rates by normal standards  
(persons whose medical histories include serious illness such as heart disease or whose physical conditions are such that  
they are rated below standard.) A policy may specifically deny benefits for death caused by a specific illness or medical  
condition or may provide only partial benefits. Many risks that would have been rejected as uninsurable under earlier  
underwriting standards, either because of their hazardous occupations or physical impairment, now can be insured under  
an extra-risk policy at an extra premium; even applicants who have survived cancer may be acceptable. The premium  
may include an extra flat fee per thousand dollars of coverage, or is one that would normally be charged to an older  
person. See also RATED POLICY.

SUBSTANTIAL OWNER effective proprietor of a business. Under the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986, a uniform  
accrual rule prevents a qualified PENSION PLAN from being weighted in favor of the substantial owner of the  
business. The owner can select the accrual method to be applied provided the same method is used for all qualified  
employees of the business.  
SUBSTANTIAL OWNER BENEFIT LIMITATION restriction on the benefit that owners and other highly  
compensated individuals may receive from a qualified pension or other employee benefits. The U.S. Tax Code requires  
that benefits under a qualified plan, and some other benefits, do not unduly favor a business firm's top hierarchy. The  
TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986 provides a uniform definition of ''highly compensated" as an employee who either  
owned more than 5% interest in the business, received more than $75,000 in compensation, received more than $50,000  
in compensation and was in the top 20% of employees as ranked by salary, or was an officer and received compensation  
greater than 150% of Section 415 defined contribution dollar amount. See also SUBSTANTIAL OWNER.  
SUCCESSION BENEFICIARY CLAUSE section of a LIFE INSURANCE policy setting the procedure for revoking a  
current beneficiary and designating a successor beneficiary. Insurers require written notice of a beneficiary change,  
usually on a form designated for that purpose. Some may require return of the policy for the beneficiary change to be  
added. See also BENEFICIARY; BENEFICIARY CLAUSE.  
SUCCESSOR BENEFICIARY see SUCCESSION BENEFICIARY CLAUSE.

legal action to protect the ship and its cargo, are reimbursed by the insurer to the extent they reduce the loss otherwise  
payable by the insurer, according to policy terms.  
SUE, LABOR, AND TRAVEL CLAUSE see SUE AND LABOR CLAUSE.  
SUICIDE CLAUSE limitation in all life insurance policies to the effect that no death payment will be made if an

the economy. As a society moves from an agriculture-based economy to an industry-based economy, the transferring of  
the PURE RISK from the family to the insurance company becomes more expedient.  
SUPERSEDED SURETYSHIP RIDER endorsement to a FIDELITY BOND or SURETY BOND to cover losses that  
occurred after lapse of the DISCOVERY PERIOD of the previous bond. Coverage is limited to the amount provided by  
the previous bond.  
SUPPLEMENTAL ACCIDENT EXPENSE see GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE.  
SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT FORMULA procedure in Social Security that sets the benefit level for a dependent of a  
retired or disabled person who is receiving Social Security benefits. For example, if a retired or disabled worker has a  
spouse over age 65, the spouse is entitled to a benefit that is 50% of that paid to the primary recipient. This benefit is  
also available to dependent children. Further, the spouse can elect to take a reduced benefit if he or she is between ages  
62 and 65.

SUPPLEMENTAL LIABILITY INSURANCE broad excess protection for liability over the level of primary coverage  
or self insurance. Umbrella policies are written for both business and personal liability. For example, a personal  
umbrella policy might add $1 million in

Page 496  
liability coverage for an insured's negligent use of a car, boat, and all other property, over and above regular coverage.  
For a business, its applications would be even broader, including workers compensation, general liability, and all other  
coverage. Policyholders must have a certain minimum level of primary insurance before they can buy this supplemental  
coverage. For a personal policy the minimum might be $100,000 in homeowners liability insurance and $500,000 per  
accident for bodily injury in an auto policy. See also UMBRELLA LIABILITY INSURANCE.

SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME (SSI) income supplement program under Social Security to provide a  
minimum monthly income to aged, blind, and disabled persons. The SSI payments, which were introduced in January  
1974, make up the difference between family income and a guaranteed minimum amount for families who have only a  
specified amount of other resources such as savings accounts.  
SUPPLEMENTAL TERM LIFE INSURANCE extra life insurance benefit found in the FAMILY INCOME POLICY,  
FAMILY INCOME RIDER, FAMILY MAINTENANCE POLICY, and FAMILY POLICY payable to the  
BENEFICIARY should the INSURED die within a stipulated time period.  
SUPPLEMENTARY CONTRACT terms of a settlement of a life insurance or annuity contract under which monies are  
currently payable or used at least in part by the beneficiary to fund a new insurance policy. Supplementary contracts are  
a balance sheet liability for a life company. They represent money held for policyholders that will eventually be paid  
out. But because the contract no longer involves insurance on a life, it is not included in the company's policy reserves.  
SUPPLEMENTARY COVERAGE in property insurance, percentages of basic coverages which may be applied to  
provide coverage for other real and personal property. For example, under the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE  
POLICYSECTION I (PROPERTY COVERAGE) Coverage B, structures not attached to or part of the home (garage or  
appurtenant private structures) can be covered up to 10% of the basic home structure as found under Coverage A.  
SUPPLEMENTARY MEDICAL INSURANCE part of the federal Medicare program for additional coverage on a  
voluntary basis. The Medicare program is divided into two parts: (1) Hospital Insurance provides hospital benefits to  
persons over 65 who qualify for Social Security, and to disabled persons who have been receiving Social Security  
benefits for at least two years; and (2) SUPPLEMENTARY MEDICAL INSURANCE provides physician services to  
those over 65, and their

dependents, who have enrolled in the program. Those enrolled in the program pay half the cost, and the U.S.  
government pays the other half.  
SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS in a LIABILITY INSURANCE policy, provision for the payment of the insured's  
expenses as stated in the policy in three areas above the policy limit of liability: legal fees resulting from defending the  
insured, expenses incurred by the insured as the result of legal actions taken against him or her as the result of requests  
by the insurance company, and premium payments for bonds required by the insured.

and developing rating tables.  
SURETY BOND contract by which one party agrees to make good the default or debt of another. Actually, three parties  
are involved: the principal, who has primary responsibility to perform the obligation (after which the bond becomes  
void); the surety, the individual with the secondary responsibility of performing the obligation if the principal fails to  
perform. (After the surety performs, recourse is against the principal for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the  
surety in the performance of the obligation, known as surety's right of exoneration); and the obligee, to whom the right  
of performance (obligation) is owed.  
SURETY BOND GUARANTEE PROGRAM program instituted by the Small Business Administration (SBA) that

SURPLUS ADEQUACY RATIO insurance company's ADJUSTED SURPLUS divided by its ADJUSTED  
LIABILITIES. The greater this ratio, the greater the financial strength of the company that can be used for writing new  
business and covering benefit payments.  
SURPLUS LINES  
Reinsurance: SURPLUS REINSURANCE contracts under which the agreement between an insurer and a reinsurer is  
based on the ceding company's line guide, such that the amount reinsured is expressed in terms of the multiples of the  
retention and is referred to as a number of lines. See also SURPLUS REINSURANCE.  
Regular market: insurance coverage not available from an ADMITTED COMPANY in the regular market; thus a  
surplus lines broker agent representing an applicant seeks coverage in the surplus lines market from a NONADMITTED  
INSURER according to the insurance regulations of a particular state.  
SURPLUS LINES BROKER see EXCESS LINE BROKER (SURPLUS LINE BROKER).  
SURPLUS LINES (EXCESS-SURPLUS LINES) specialized property or liability coverage provided by a  
NONADMITTED INSURER in instances where it is unavailable from insurers licensed by the state. Examples of  
surplus lines are coverage for some environmental impairment liability risks, or liability coverage for directors and  
officers of certain companies. See also EXCESS LINE BROKER (SURPLUS LINE BROKER).  
SURPLUS RATIO percentage of total assets set aside by an insurance company to provide for unexpected losses. In  
general, a minimum of a 5% surplus ratio (5 cents in reserve for each $1 of assets) is advocated for determining whether  
the company has an adequate reserve against unexpected losses.  
SURPLUS REINSURANCE automatic REINSURANCE that requires an insurer to transfer (CEDE) and the reinsurer  
to accept the part of every risk that exceeds the insurer's predetermined retention limit. The rein-surer shares in  
premiums and losses in the same proportion as it shares in the total policy limits of the risk. The surplus method permits  
the insurer to keep for its own account small policies, and to transfer the amount of risk on large policies above its  
retention limit. For example, assume an insurer issues a policy for $20,000. The insurer keeps $5000 (1/4) and transfers  
the remaining $15,000 (1/4) to its reinsurer. This is called a three line surplus because the amount transferred equals  
three times the retained line of the insurer. The insurer keeps 1/4 of the premium and transfers 3/4 of the premium to the  
reinsurer. In the event of total loss, the settlements between the insurer and the reinsurer would be effected on the  
identical 1/4 - 3/4 basis. The same principal applies if there  
< previous page page_498 next page >  
 
< previous page page_499 next page >  
Page 499  
is a partial loss, in that the reinsurer must reimburse the insurer in the same proportion as the reinsurance premium  
received.  
SURPLUS RELIEF insurance company's REINSURANCE COMMISSIONS AND EXPENSE ALLOWANCES  
divided by its ADJUSTED SURPLUS account. The smaller this ratio, the more financially sound the insurance  
company, since this ratio shows the extent to which the insurance company relies on reinsurance to maintain its surplus  
strength.

SURRENDER CHARGE fee charged to a policyowner when a life insurance policy or annuity is surrendered for its  
cash value. This fee reflects insurance company expenses incurred by placing the policy on its books, and subsequent  
administrative expenses. See also BACK LOAD.  
SURRENDER COST INDEX method of comparing the costs of a set of CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE policies  
that takes into account the TIME VALUE OF MONEY. The true costs of alternative cash value policies with the same  
death benefit depend on a number of factorsamount and timing of premiums paid, amount and timing of dividends (in  
the case of participating policies), time period involved, and the CASH SURRENDER VALUE. In evaluating a  
particular group of policies, a surrender cost index can be calculated using INTEREST ADJUSTED COST comparison.  
The index ranks the policies for the same period of time, say the first 20 years of the policy life, by cost per $1000 of  
FACE AMOUNT, showing the cheapest through the most expensive. In effect, the index illustrates the relative cost of  
acquiring a dollar's worth of each policy's cash surrender value after 20 years. Contrast with the NET PAYMENTS  
INDEX, a ranking of policy costs using the traditional net cost method of comparison that ignores the time value of  
money and thus gives a less accurate picture of relative policy costs.  
SURRENDER COST METHOD see SURRENDER COST INDEX.  
SURRENDER, LIFE INSURANCE action by the owner of a cash value policy to relinquish it for its CASH  
SURRENDER VALUE. Since the depression of the 1930s, companies have reserved the right to delay payment of a  
cash surrender value up to six months; however, payments have been prompt.

SURVIVAL STATUTE see UNIFORM SIMULTANEOUS DEATH ACT.  
SURVIVOR PURCHASE OPTION provision applied as a RIDER attached to an ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE  
POLICY for the purpose of meeting ESTATE PLANNING requirements. When the INSURED dies, the  
BENEFICIARY is entitled to receive the DEATH BENEFIT in cash or to use the death benefit to purchase a new  
ordinary life insurance policy. This new policy is not subject to additional underwriting requirements and has, as the  
date of issue, the same time as the original policy. The initial premium due is automatically subtracted from the original  
policy's death benefit.  
SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY agreement under which an annuitant receives a predetermined monthly income benefit  
for life upon the death of the insured. Should the annuitant predecease the insured, the contract is terminated and no  
benefits are ever paid. The life expectancy of both the insured and annuitant must be taken into consideration in  
determining the premium, and such, the annuitant cannot be changed once selected. This is also called a revisionary  
annuity (a life insurance policy combined with an annuity agreement).  
SURVIVORSHIP BENEFIT retirement income benefit of a survivor (or survivors) of an insured individual, according  
to a particular formula. For example, if a retired male worker dies, all or a portion of his monthly pension (perhaps one  
half or two-thirds) may continue to go to his wife if he has elected the JOINT AND SURVIVOR OPTION. Survivors of  
a person entitled to Social Security benefits may also be entitled to receive a survivorship benefit. For example, a  
widower may get as much as 100% of his wife's benefits, if claimed at age 65 or over.  
SURVIVORSHIP CLAUSE see COMMON DISASTER CLAUSE (SURVIVOR-SHIP CLAUSE).  
SURVIVORSHIP INCOME PAYMENTS see SURVIVORSHIP BENEFIT.  
SURVIVORSHIP LIFE INSURANCE coverage on more than one person that pays a benefit after all of the insureds  
die. This type of joint life policy is significantly cheaper than a regular policy. Survivorship life insurance might be used  
to help fund estate taxes after the deaths of a husband and wife or as a form of business continuation insurance. See also  
TONTINE.  
SURVIVORSHIP SPLIT DOLLAR INSURANCE modification of SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE policy in that  
the death benefit becomes payable upon the second death. This type of policy is ideal in those circumstances when  
ESTATE TAXES must be paid, which is usually the case upon the death of the second spouse. Since this is a second-todie  
policy, the premiums are substantially lower than those for a single life insurance policy. The procedure is for two  
individuals (usually spouses)  
< previous page page_500 next page >  
 
< previous page page_501 next page >  
Page 501  
to form a LIFE INSURANCE TRUST and then to enter into a SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE agreement with  
the trust. The individual(s) pay(s) that portion of the premium equal to the CASH VALUE of the policy and the trust  
pays the term cost of the premium. The individual is reimbursed for the premiums paid when the death benefit is paid or  
when the policy is surrendered for its CASH SURRENDER VALUE. The remainder of the death proceeds is paid to the  
LIFE INSURANCE TRUST.  
SURVIVOR'S RIGHT TO SUE legal recourse available to survivors of a person who suffers a wrongful death. Under  
COMMON LAW, only an injured person had the right to sue for damages. If a wrongfully injured person died of those  
injuries, there was no one with a legal right to sue to recover damages for the death. State laws now provide for the right  
of the survivor to sue, not just for the wrongful death but for loss of income and other losses.  
SUSPENSION OF COVERAGE interruption of insurance provided for in most property insurance policies under  
circumstances where a substantial increase in hazard has arisen with the knowledge or control of the insured. The  
policy's WORK AND MATERIALS CLAUSE gives the insured the right to use materials and processes needed in his  
or her business without facing suspension from increased hazard. But major changes in the characteristics of the risk  
will trigger suspension of coverage. For example, a building used to warehouse dry goods when fire insurance first is  
written on it may be converted by the insured to store paint. The substantial increase in hazard results in suspension of  
coverage. Vacancy for more than 60 days and riot or explosion also result in suspension. Coverage is reinstated  
automatically for the remainder of the policy term when the condition that triggered suspension is corrected.  
SUSPENSION PROVISION see SUSPENSION OF COVERAGE.  
SYMMETRIC RISK EXPOSURE gain that occurs when the move in the underlying asset in one direction is similar to  
the loss when the underlying asset moves in the opposite direction. For example, if a stock goes up by X dollars, there is  
an X dollar gain. On the other hand, if a stock goes down by X dollars, there is an X dollar loss.  
SYNDICATE group of insurers or reinsurers involved in joint underwriting. Members typically take predetermined  
shares of premiums, losses, expenses, and profits. Syndicates, more common in REINSURANCE than in PRIMARY  
INSURANCE, are formed to cover major risks that are beyond the CAPACITY of a single underwriter. See also POOL;  
POOLING.  
SYNDICATE POLICY INSURANCE POLICY underwritten and issued by a SYNDICATE listing each RISK insured

the insurance company as is the case with the GIC. This ownership right is of particular importance if there is a concern  
about the long-term financial soundness of an insurance company. The synthetic plan segregates the plan's assets from  
the assets of the insurance company.  
SYNTHETIC PRODUCTS type of GUARANTEED INVESTMENTS CONTRACT that enables the sponsor of the

TAIL COVERAGE liability insurance that extends beyond the end of the policy period of a liability insurance policy  
written on a claims-made basis. Liability claims are often made long after the accident or event that caused the injury.  
Many liability policies are written on a claims-made basis, which means the insurer pays only claims that are received  
during the policy period. In that case, an insured needs tail coverage to protect against claims not known about at the  
end of the policy period. For example, a doctor retires, allows her insurance policy to lapse, and a claim comes in six  
months later. In order to protect herself, the doctor purchases tail coverage.  
TAPES INSURANCE see DATA PROCESSING INSURANCE.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD tax-free yield � (1 individual's combined federal and state income tax bracket).  
The calculation is made according to the following steps:  
1. Determine individual's effective state tax rate (percentage that individual pays in state taxes after deduction of these  
state taxes from his or her federal tax).  
where: effective state tax rate = (state tax rate + local tax rate) x (1 federal income tax rate).  
Assume that the individual's taxable income is $60,000. The individual is in the 33% federal marginal income tax  
bracket, and his or her state tax rate on dividend income is 7.9%. Then the effective state tax rate = 0.079(1 0.33) =  
0.05293.  
2. Determine individual's combined federal and state income tax bracket (federal marginal tax rate + effective state tax  
rate). For the above example, this relationship equals 0.33 + 0.05293 = 0.38293.  
3. Determine taxable-equivalent yield. Assume, for the above example, that an individual is considering an investment  
that has a tax-free yield of 8%. Then  
TAXABLE INCOME earned and unearned income on which current taxes must be paid. Tax avoidance is one of the  
goals of investment, and various tax-free or tax-deferred investments have been devised for this purpose. In the past,  
real estate and oil and gas limited partner-ships have been a method of avoiding tax on current income, but changing tax  
legislation frequently alters the nature of taxable income and the taxes that must be paid on it. For example, the TAX  
REFORM ACT  
< previous page page_504 next page >  
 
< previous page page_505 next page >  
Page 505  
OF 1986 eliminated contributions to INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS as a deduction for many taxpayers.  
Insurance products have long enjoyed special tax benefits because of the belief in the importance of protecting one's  
family. For example, the interest buildup in annuities is allowed to accumulate, tax deferred. Taxes are paid on the  
earnings only when the money is withdrawn. Because the 1986 federal tax law eliminated so many other forms of tax  
shelters, insurance products became even more attractive for these properties.  
TAX ADVANTAGES OF QUALIFIED PLAN see PENSION PLAN.  
TAX-APPRAISED VALUE estimate of an asset that is used to determine tax obligations. It is usually in the interest of  
the owner to have a low value put on a piece of property for tax purposes. However, the owner sometimes wants the  
same property to carry a higher appraisal value for insurance purposes so that losses can be easily recovered if the  
property is lost or damaged.

TAX BENEFITS OF ANNUITY see ANNUITY.  
TAX BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE tax advantages of investing in life insurance fall into two main areas: (1)  
TAX DEFERRAL on untaxed buildup of earnings in such cash value policies as whole life insurance and annuities, and  
(2) exclusion from federal income tax of the proceeds of a death benefit of an insurance policy. See also TAX  
REFORM ACT OF 1986.  
TAX BRACKET SHIFTING arrangement of financial affairs such that a family member who is in a lower income tax  
bracket receives  
< previous page page_505 next page >  
 
< previous page page_506 next page >  
Page 506  
income that another family member would otherwise have received (thereby reducing the taxes paid by the family unit).  
TAX DEFERRAL postponement of taxes on investment or other earnings until the investor begins to consume them  
and anticipates being in a lower tax bracket. One example of a tax-deferred investment is an INDIVIDUAL  
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA). Earnings accumulate tax free until the account holder retires after age 59 1/2. At  
that time, taxes must be paid on the earnings as money is withdrawn from the account. Other examples of tax deferred  
investments are insurance products such as annuities and various types of whole life insurance such as VARIABLE  
LIFE and UNIVERSAL LIFE. The TAX REFORMACT OF 1986 limited the use of IRAs, making insurance products  
one of the few tax-deferred investments still available.  
TAX DEFERRED ANNUITY (TDA) retirement vehicle permitted under SECTION 403 (B) PLAN of the U.S. Internal  
Revenue Code for employees of a public school system or a qualified charitable organization. Under such an agreement,  
the maximum annual contribution is $4500. Cash values and dividends accrue but are not taxed until the annuitant  
actually receives benefits. At that time, the annuitant is taxed only on the amount that exceeds the investment in the  
annuity. Should the annuitant receive a monthly benefit under one of the various annuities, the percentage of each  
payment that would not be subject to taxation is determined by the exclusion ratio:  
where the expected return under the annuity equals the life expectancy of the annuitant x the annual income payment.  
For example, if an annuitant invested $40,000 in an annuity, and at age 60 has a 14-year life expectancy, and receives an  
annual income of $5000, then 57.14% of each income payment would not be subject to taxation.  
TAX EQUITY AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACTS OF 1982 AND 1983 (TEFRA) legislation that redefined  
life insurance and raised taxes on life insurance companies. Among the provisions were new rules for some life  
insurance products, including a definition of FLEXIBLE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE, and an increase in life  
insurance company taxes. Congress was concerned that a policyholder could take a substantial amount, say $1 million,  
and, after putting a few dollars toward a life insurance premium, put the remainder into a tax-free investment vehicle.  
One of two tests had to be satisfied for a policy to qualify as life insurance: (1) the cash surrender value policy could not  
exceed a net single premium, and (2) the death benefit had to represent a certain percentage of the cash value, which  
declined as the policy-holder got older. For example, at age 40, the death benefit must be  
< previous page page_506 next page >  
 
< previous page page_507 next page >  
Page 507  
140% of cash value. The second rule closed a loophole on tax-free withdrawals from annuities. Prior to 1982 annuity  
holders could withdraw their initial premium tax free at any time. The 1982 code decreed that any money withdrawn  
from an annuity would be considered income first and would therefore be taxable.  
The older 1959 tax code devised a shorthand formula for determining taxes paid by insurers. The formula worked when  
interest rates were low, but as they soared, insurers found ways to reduce the increased tax bite. The 1982 code  
introduced a stopgap measure designed to raise taxes on life insurers by $3 billion.  
TAX-EQUIVALENT INCOME tax-exempt income that, for comparative purposes, has been increased by an amount  
equal to the taxes that would be paid if this income were fully taxable at statutory rates. See also TAXABLEEQUIVALENT

TAX-FREE EXCHANGE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS under Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code,  
stipulation that the exchange of one life insurance policy for another life insurance policy will generally not result in a  
recognized gain for the purpose of federal income tax purposes to the policyowner who exchanges the policy. The  
insured must be the same person under both policies. If the policy owner should surrender the second policy in a taxable  
transaction, the untaxed gain is then recognized. The types of policy exchanges that can be made on a tax-free basis are  
as follows: (1) a life insurance policy for another life insurance policy; (2) a life insurance policy for an annuity  
contract; and (3) an annuity contract for another annuity contract. An annuity contract cannot be exchanged on a taxfree  
basis for a life insurance policy. The ANNUITANT must be the same person under both annuity contracts in order  
to maintain the tax-free basis. See also MINIMUM DEPOSIT RESCUE.  
TAX-FREE INCOME see TAXATION, PARTICIPATING DIVIDENDS; TAX BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE;

TAX-FREE MONEY MUTUAL FUNDS investments restricted to short-term financial instruments issued by state, city,  
and county governments and agencies. Interest paid by those instruments are not subject to federal income tax, thus  
their attraction for high income tax bracket investors.  
TAX-FREE ROLLOVER  
1. transfer of money from or an employer-sponsored pension or other qualified plan into an INDIVIDUAL  
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) without paying tax on the distribution.  
2. transfer of money from one individual retirement account to another without paying tax.

account to another can be accomplished either by withholding the money from one account and depositing it in another  
within 60 days, or by instructing one institution to transfer it to a second. As long as the new deposit is made within 60  
days, there is no current tax liability.  
TAX LIEN claim against property for payment of taxes. Life insurance proceeds and annuity benefits are protected  
against certain creditors of the insured, but the federal government is not one of them. Thus life insurance and annuity  
benefits can be held liable if the federal government has a tax lien against the insured.  
TAX MULTIPLIER factor applied in RETROSPECTIVE RATING in order to increase the BASIC PREMIUM to  
cover state premium taxes for liability and workers compensation insurance. For example, if a state premium tax is 2%,  
the tax multiplier used in the formula to determine the retrospective premium would be 1.02.  
TAX PLANNING arrangement of discretionary income, expenses, and investments in a way that enhances after-tax  
wealth. Insurance policies can be used to increase after-tax income through the tax-deferral features of CASH VALUE  
LIFE INSURANCE and to reduce estate taxes through the preferential tax treatment of the life insurance DEATH  
BENEFIT. See also ESTATE PLANNING.  
TAX REDUCTION FLEXIBLE BENEFITS PLAN (SECTION 125 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE  
CODE) plan in which participant (employee) utilizes SPENDING ACCOUNTS to pay for health care costs not subject  
to reimbursement from a health insurance policy or health care provider. The reimbursement is for the participant as  
well as the participant's dependent(s). Before the plan year (usually July 1 through June 30) begins, the participant  
decides the amount he or she desires to contribute to the HEALTH CARE ACCOUNT and/or the DEPENDENT CARE  
ACCOUNT. The maximum amount that can be contributed to the Health Care account is $2000 per year and $5000 to  
the Dependent Care account. The minimum contribution each year to each account is $300. Any amount, subject to the  
maximum and minimum, may be chosen by the participant to be deducted in equal installments from the participant's  
employment income during the plan year. The amount chosen is deducted before taxes are subtracted, thus making the  
contribution tax-free. As health care expenses are paid by the participant, the participant files a claim with the employer  
and is reimbursed from the Health Care or Dependent Day Care account. At the conclusion of the plan year, under IRS  
regulations any funds remaining in either the Health Care or the Dependent Care account are forfeited by the employee;  
the employer receives the forfeited funds.  
The particulars of the Health Care account are as follows:  
1. Participant and dependent health care expenses that are not covered under an insurance policy or health care provider  
agreement are  
< previous page page_508 next page >  
 
< previous page page_509 next page >  
Page 509  
paid for by the participant. The participant in turn submits a claim to the employer for that amount and is reimbursed by  
the employer from the Health Care or Dependent Care account.  
2. Any funds remaining in the Health Care or Dependent Care account at the end of the plan year are forfeited by the  
participant to the employer.  
3. Employees who work at least 30 hours per week are eligible to participate in the plan.  
4. An open enrollment period is held during the plan year. During this time, the employee can elect whether or not to  
participate in the plan, to open the Health Care and/or Dependent Care accounts, and the amount to be contributed from  
each check to each account, subject to a minimum contribution of $300 per year for both accounts and a maximum  
amount per year of $2000 and $5000 for the Health Care account and the Dependent Care account, respectively.  
5. The Health Care Account and the Dependent Care accounts are separate entities. As such, monies from one account  
cannot be transferred to the other account.  
6. Changes in the elections may be made only during the open enrollment period each year or when a qualifying change  
in the participant's family status occurs. A qualifying change occurs when a child is born or adopted; marriage, divorce,  
or legal separation occurs; dependent dies or becomes disabled; and the employment status of the participant and/or the  
participant's spouse changes.  
7. The participant will receive on a quarterly basis a listing of the activities in the account(s). Notification is sent to the  
participant in advance of a possible forfeiture of funds in the account(s) at the end of the plan year.  
8. Health care claims are paid up to a maximum amount equal to the contribution into that account each year less any  
reimbursements paid out of the respective account during the plan year.  
9. The participant is reimbursed for those health care expenses not covered under a health insurance policy or by a  
health care provider to include: (a) nonreimbursed medical expenses resulting from charges due to hospital, physician,  
dental, orthodontia, vision, and prescription drug expenses incurred; (b) deductibles and copayments resulting from  
charges due to hospital, physician, dental, orthodontia, vision, and prescription drug expenses incurred; (c) routine  
physicals; (d) rehabilitation services over a long-term period to include drug and alcohol addiction; (e) health care  
expenses that meet medical expense requirements for federal income tax purposes.  
10. Deductible expenses for the Health Care Spending account include: (a) medical deductible (amount under  
COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE); (b) copayment (medical, dental, orthodontia); (c) prescription drugs  
unless otherwise covered; (d) routine physical examinations unless otherwise covered; (e) vision examinations.

The particulars of the Dependent Care account include those dependent care expenses that are associated with the  
participant's work requirements:  
1. Day care costs for children age 12 and less.  
2. Education-related expenses for children who have not yet attended the first grade.  
3. Day care costs in the home to include housekeeping expenses.  
4. Licensed day care expenses to include those associated with babysitting.  
5. Day care costs associated with individuals who reside with the participant and obtain at least half of their monetary  
support from the participant.  
6. Day care costs associated with the participant's dependents who are physically or mentally incapable of caring for  
themselves, such as mentally retarded individuals or elderly parents.  
TAX REFORM ACT OF 1976 legislation that provided temporary rules for implementing the EMPLOYEE  
RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA).  
TAX REFORM ACT OF 1984 legislation that raised taxes on life insurers and further defined life insurance. Because  
the TAX EQUITY AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1982 AND 1983 (TEFRA) failed to raise the  
amount of revenue the U.S. Treasury wanted, the 1984 Act again raised the corporate tax on life insurance companies. It  
also expanded the definition of life insurance to all life insurance contracts, rather than just those with flexible  
premiums that had been addressed in the Tax Reform Act of 1982. For FLEXIBLE PREMIUM contracts, the 1982 Act  
established the death benefits had to represent a certain percentage of the cash value, which declined as the policyholder  
got older. The 1984 Act raised that ratio. For example, at age 40, the death benefit must be at least 250% of cash value  
for the product to qualify as life insurance. This act also attempted to redistribute the tax burden between mutual and  
stock life insurance companies. It also replaced a three-tier structure for taxing life insurance companies with a singlephase  
structure.  
TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986 legislation to eliminate most tax shelters and write-offs in exchange for lower rates for  
both corporation and individuals. It was intended to be revenue neutral; that is, to bring in the same amount of revenue  
as the previous law.  
1. For individuals, it eliminated deductions for most tax shelters such as tax-advantaged limited partnerships; it  
eliminated special treatment for capital gains by taxing them at the same rate as ordinary income.  
2. Deductions for an INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) no longer applied to those with incomes above  
$35,000 and couples above $50,000 unless they had no company pension plan. Individuals with incomes between  
$25,000 and $35,000 and couples between $40,000 and $50,000 got a partial deduction.  
< previous page page_510 next page >

Page 511  
3. For company-sponsored 401 (k) salary reduction plans, the maximum annual limit was reduced from $30,000 to  
$7000; antidiscrimination rules were tightened; and a 10% penalty was imposed for withdrawals before age 59 1/2.  
4. Other administrative changes made it more expensive for companies to start or maintain a company pension plan.  
5. CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE was one of the few retirement vehicles to retain its tax-deferred status.  
6. Top individual tax rates were reduced from a series of rates going up to 50% to two rates: 15% and 28%, although the  
top marginal rate was 33%.  
7. The top corporate rate down from 46% to 34%.  
8. The investment tax credit was eliminated and depreciation schedules were lengthened.  
9. Many industries lost special advantages they held under the old code.  
10. The alternative minimum tax was stiffened for individuals and one was added for corporations.  
TAX-SHELTERED ANNUITY (TSA) see TAX-DEFERRED ANNUITY (TDA).  
TEACHERS INSURANCE AND ANNUITY ASSOCIATIONCOLLEGE RETIREMENT EQUITIES FUND (TIAACREF)  
life insurance company that sells life insurance and annuities to the faculty and staff of colleges and universities.  
Its TIAA-CREF Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA) uses a traditional FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY, the TIAA portion, and a  
VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY, the CREF portion. Most participants have a SPLIT FUNDED PLAN with 50% of  
the premium going to each, but this proportion can be changed as often as a participant desires. See also TAX  
DEFERRED ANNUITY (TDA).  
TECHNICAL AND MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE ACT OF 1988 (TAMRA): CHILDREN'S EDUCATION  
determination that investments by parents in their children's education through the purchase of Series EE Savings  
Bonds, which generate interest income, are tax-exempt if the proceeds are applied to qualified education expenses. To  
qualify for this tax exemption, the following criteria must be met:  
1. In order for education expenses to qualify, they must be incurred in the year of redemption of the bonds. Such  
expenses include tuition and required fees. In a year in which the proceeds from the redeemed bonds are greater than the  
qualifying expenses, a prorated percentage of the redeemed bonds' earnings becomes taxable income for that year.  
2. In order for the education expenses to qualify, they must be the expenses of the bond's purchaser or those of the  
purchaser's dependent in the year of redemption of the bonds.  
3. In order for the education expenses to qualify, the purchaser of the bonds must be at least 24 years of age and the  
bonds must be in the name of the purchaser or in the joint names of the purchaser and his  
< previous page page_511 next page >  
 
< previous page page_512 next page >  
Page 512  
or her spouse. Also, married individuals must file joint tax returns.  
4. Bonds purchased must have been issued after December 31, 1987.  
TECHNICAL AND MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE ACT OF 1988 (TAMRA): EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  
determination that group plans offering legal services are limited to an annual tax-free benefit of $70 per employee;  
group plans may offer employer-provided educational assistance plans on a tax-exclusion basis to employees, with the  
exception of graduate school expenses; if an employer elects to treat highly compensated employees as those earning in  
excess of $50,000, then the employer must have significant business operations in at least two geographically separate  
locations; and each plan must be tested for discrimination on a date to be chosen by the employer in 1990, and the same  
date must be used each year in the future unless a date change is approved in advance by the Secretary of the Treasury.  
TECHNICAL AND MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE ACT OF 1988 (TAMRA): INCOME TAXATION OF CASH  
VALUE LIFE INSURANCE determination that policies entered into on or after June 21, 1988, that fail the 7-pay test  
(aggregate premiums paid at any time during the first 7 years of the contract exceed the annual net level premium of a 7-  
pay policy multiplied by the number of years the policy has been in force) are considered by the Internal Revenue  
Service (IRS) to be modified endowment contracts (MECs). If the policy is determined to be a MEC, it may be subject  
to income taxes as well as penalty taxes. Any policy loans, dividends, or partial withdrawals of funds are treated by the  
IRS for income tax purposes on a last-in, first-out basis.  
TELEGRAM PROPOSAL OF INSURANCE binding contract for insurance completed by telegraph. The law has  
recognized the date an insurance agreement is made as the date that coverage commences, rather than the date stated on  
the insurance policy. Acceptance of a proposal by telegram, like a letter or an oral agreement, represents a binding  
contract.  
TELE-UNDERWRITING procedure in which a home office interviewer (who may or may not have UNDERWRITING  
experience) interviews APPLICANTS on the telephone. The questions asked the applicant are automated and scripted.  
The applicant's response to a particular question triggers the interviewer to either ask more details about the response or  
to ask another question. This procedure lists among its benefits: reduction in the time required to process applications;  
delivery of policies in a shorter period of time; nonduplication of the same question asked by agents, medical  
examiners, and underwriters; reduction in the number of omitted answers to questions on the application; and the  
reduction of paperwork required by an agent.  
TEMPERATURE EXTREMES EXCLUSION provision in an ALL RISKS INLAND MARINE policy that denies  
coverage for exposure to  
< previous page page_512 next page >  
 
< previous page page_513 next page >  
Page 513  
dampness and extremes of temperature. Some property, like living plants, might be particularly vulnerable to extremes  
of temperature and is not considered as insurable risk.  
TEMPORARY DISABILITY BENEFITS income paid to a worker who is temporarily disabled by an injury or sickness  
that is not work related. Compare with WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS, which are available only to  
workers injured on the job. And unemployment benefits are available only to those who are able to work. Temporary  
disability benefits fill in for those who cannot work because of illness and who were not injured on the job. After a  
waiting period that is typically about a week, the disabled worker is paid a weekly income. Temporary disability  
benefits may come from a group benefit plan, from a union medical plan, or, in some cases, from a state insurance fund.  
Five states have temporary disability plans: California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island.  
TEMPORARY LIFE ANNUITY ANNUITY that provides income payments for a number of years provided the  
ANNUITANT is alive to receive them. All income payments cease upon the death of the annuitant.  
TEMPORARY LIFE ANNUITY DUE limited number of payments, the first of which is due immediately, and  
payments thereafter are contingent upon the designated beneficiary (the ANNUITANT) continuing to live. After the  
limit has been reached all payments cease even if the annuitant is still alive.  
TEMPORARY LIFE INSURANCE see TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
TEMPORARY MAJOR MEDICAL INSURANCE modification of the MAJOR MEDICAL INSURANCE policy that  
provides coverage for the terminating employee who otherwise would not be covered by a health insurance policy.  
Usually, this coverage is for no more than six months and cannot be renewed.  
TEMPORARY NONOCCUPATIONAL DISABILITY PLAN social insurance that provides benefits to temporarily  
disabled workers in a few states. Five states require employers to pay cash benefits if work-ers are disabled. They are  
Rhode Island, California, New Jersey, New York, and Hawaii.  
TEMPORARY PARTIAL, TOTAL DISABILITY see DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE; TEMPORARY  
DISABILITY BENEFITS.  
TENANCY see ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION: JOINT TENANTS; TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY.  
TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY ownership of property by a husband and wife together; the law views the couple as  
one person. This can have a bearing on insurance claims. For example, if the wife willfully destroys property, her  
husband's claim may be denied by an insurer on the grounds that he is not separate from his wife for insurance purposes,  
< previous page page_513 next page >  
 
< previous page page_514 next page >  
Page 514  
and this constitutes destruction by the insured. Contrasts with TENANTS IN COMMON.  
TENANTS IMPROVEMENTS AND BETTERMENTS improvements or renovations to a leased business or residential  
property made by a tenant to meet its particular needs. Loss of use of these improvements as a result of damage is  
covered by an endorsement to the Standard Fire Policy.  
TENANTS IN COMMON ownership of property by two or more persons who do not have rights of survivorship. The  
share of a deceased tenant passes to that person's heirs and not to the other tenants. Because insurance is a personal  
contract, all parties with an interest in the property must be listed. When filing an insurance claim, the policyholder  
must prove there was a loss and that the property damaged belonged to the policy holder. For example, four tenants in  
common own a resort condominium. Only one is listed on the insurance policy. A fire destroys the condo. The insurer  
probably could argue successfully that the interests of the other three are not covered.  
TENANTS INSURANCE coverage for the contents of a renter's home or apartment and for liability. Tenant policies are  
similar to homeowners insurance, except that they do not cover the structure. They do, however, cover changes made to  
the inside structure, such as carpeting, kitchen appliances, and built-in bookshelves.  
TENDER OFFER DEFENSE EXPENSE INSURANCE coverage for defense costs incurred in defending a company  
from an unfriendly takeover attempt. Hostile takeovers have been one of the hottest business topics in recent years.  
Vulnerable companies have responded in a variety of ways including changing the corporate bylaws, selling off their  
most attractive assets, and, in the last resort, voting themselves huge severance packages or ''golden parachutes." When  
a company or individual makes a tender offer for the stock of its takeover target, the latter company usually hires legal  
experts and mounts a costly defense. This insurance is an example of a specialized coverage that grew to meet a specific  
need.  
TENDER OF UNEARNED PREMIUM return of a pro rata portion of premium after a policy is canceled by the insurer.  
Under most property and liability insurance policies, the insurer can cancel at any time but must return to the insured the  
portion of the premium that has not been used. Although some courts have held that a policy has not been cancelled  
until the insurer returns the unearned premium, others allow the insurer to cancel the policy and inform the insured that  
the unearned premium will be refunded on demand.  
TEN-YEAR AVERAGING accounting method used to reduce income taxes on distributions from qualified pension or  
retirement plans. Ten-year averaging was repealed by the TAX REFORMACT OF 1986 but is still  
< previous page page_514 next page >  
 
< previous page page_515 next page >  
Page 515  
 
 < previous page page_515 next page >  
 
< previous page page_516 next page >  
Page 516  
available to persons who reached age 50 before January 1, 1986. They are allowed at any future date to make a one-time  
use of 10-year averaging at 1986 income tax and capital gains rates. Everyone else is limited to 5-year forward  
averaging. For those still eligible, 10-year averaging provides the opportunity to pay tax on a lump sum distribution as  
if it were the only income received over a 10-year period. For example, a lump sum distribution of $50,000 would be  
taxed at $5874. This amount is calculated as shown on the previous page.  
TEN-YEAR VESTING (CLIFF VESTING) method of vesting under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME  
SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) that requires an employee to have 10 years of service with an employer to be  
vested. An employee who leaves an employer prior to that time does not receive retirement benefits from that job.  
Under the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986, after December 31, 1988, the 10-year vesting rule is reduced to 5 years. See  
also VESTING.  
TERM period of time of insurance coverage. If a loss occurs during this time, insurance benefits are paid. If a loss  
occurs after this time period has expired, no insurance benefits are paid.  
TERMINAL DIVIDEND additional policy dividend paid to a life insurance policyholder when a policy terminates. A  
MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY is owned by its policyholders and writes participating policies, which pay annual  
policy dividends to policyholders. (Some stock insurance companies pay dividends on some policies as well.) In  
addition to the annual dividend, many policies pay a terminal dividend when the policy terminates after a minimum  
period in forceusually 10 to 20 years. This represents a realm to the policyholder of an equitable portion of the overall  
increase in the insurer's surplus over this period. Some companies pay this dividend no matter how a policy is  
terminated; others pay it only under certain conditions.  
TERMINAL FUNDING former method of funding a pension plan. When employees retire, the employer sets aside a  
lump sum that will pay them lifetime monthly benefits. When determining the amount, these factors are considered life  
expectancy, the promised monthly benefit, and expected earnings on the sum set aside. The lump sum can either be  
placed in a trust fund or used to buy an annuity. Terminal funding, along with the current disbursement method, are no  
longer permitted for qualified pension plans under the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT of  
1974 (ERISA). ERISA requires current funding of future pension liabilities.  
TERMINAL ILLNESS BENEFIT portion of the DEATH BENEFIT in a life insurance policy paid upon the insured  
being diagnosed as having a terminal illness that will result in death within a year.  
TERMINAL RESERVE life insurance reserve at the end of any policy year. Insurers are required by state regulatory  
authorities to set up reserves to pay for future claims. The initial reserve is the reserve at  
< previous page page_516 next page >  
 
< previous page page_517 next page >  
Page 517  
the beginning of the policy year; the mean reserve is the average of the initial reserve and the terminal reserve for that  
year. The terminal reserve is used for dividend distributions and to set nonforfeiture values for CASH VALUE LIFE  
INSURANCE. The terminal reserve for one policy year is the initial reserve for the next policy year.  
TERMINATION cancellation of a policy by an insurance company. See also PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY  
CORPORATION (PBGC); TERMINATION INSURANCE.  
TERMINATION DATE see EXPIRATION; EXPIRATION NOTICE.  
TERMINATION INSURANCE see PENSION PLAN TERMINATION INSURANCE.  
TERMINATION RATE measure of the rate at which policies are cancelled or allowed to lapse. The termination rate is  
a factor in setting premiums for group life and health policies.  
TERM INSURANCE see TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
TERM INSURANCE COST low-cost life insurance providing coverage only for a limited time, such as one year, five  
years, or to age 65. Term insurance costs less at younger ages than a comparable amount of CASH VALUE LIFE  
INSURANCE, or permanent insurance, which covers the remaining life of the insured. Term insurance has become  
increasingly popular; it costs less because there is less likelihood that an insured will die during the term, whereas with  
cash value insurance, a policy must pay off whenever a policyholder dies. However, the premium for term insurance  
increases dramatically as an insured grows older, but the premium for permanent insurance usually remains level  
throughout an insured's lifetime.  
TERM LIFE INSURANCE life insurance that stays in effect for only a specified, limited period. If an insured dies  
within that period, the BENEFICIARY receives the death payments. If the insured survives, the policy ends and the  
beneficiary receives nothing. For example, if an insured with a five year term policy dies within that period, the  
beneficiary receives the face amount of the policy. If the insured survives the five year period, the policy ends, with no  
benefit payable. See also ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE; RENEWABLE TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
TERM OF THE POLICY length of time INSURANCE POLICY is in force.  
TERRITORIAL GROUPING OF RISKS method of classifying risks to establish equitable rates. In many property and  
liability insurance lines, the location of an insured has a significant impact on the loss experience. For example, in  
automobile insurance the chance of a policyholder sustaining a loss is much greater in New York City than in rural  
Iowa. In lines like workers compensation, insurers may consider the attitude of the state courts and its impact on the  
cost of claims in that state. The insurer's task is to define a territorial grouping that has  
< previous page page_517 next page >  
 
< previous page page_518 next page >  
Page 518  
an exposure that is either smaller or greater than the standard, yet the group must be large enough to provide significant  
loss experience for rate making.  
TERRITORIAL LIMITS condition for INLAND MARINE liability insurance coverage that states a loss or claim must  
occur in the policy territory. Policy territory for a liability policy includes the U.S., its territories, and Canada;  
international water or air space (except for when the injured person is traveling to another country); and injuries  
sustained anywhere in the world if a product is produced in the U.S. and the suit is brought in the U.S.

TESTAMENTARY TRUST see ESTATE PLANNING DISTRIBUTION; TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITION.  
TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITION disposition or transfer of property at time of death. Although the law provides that  
property may be transferred at death only by means of a will that meets the requirements of state statutes, life insurance  
proceeds are exempt from this requirement. They pass to the stated beneficiary without regard to the state requirements  
for wills.

been operating on a profitable basis? (2) Does the TPA have a long operating record? (3) What percentage of the TPA's  
total business will your company's business comprise? (4) Does the TPA have the technical capacity (for example,  
sophisticated computer operations) to adequately service its acquired business? (5) Are current and former clients of the  
TPA positive about that TPA? (6) Are the employees of the TPA technically competent and committed to providing  
effective and efficient services? See also ADMINISTERING AGENCY; ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE; ADVISORY

THRESHOLD LEVEL minimum degree of injury or loss for which an injured party can sue, even though covered by  
NO FAULT AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE. Traditionally, an accident victim had to prove the other driver was at fault  
in order to collect damages from that driver's insurance company. Today, more than 20 states have some type of  
automobile no-fault law designed to eliminate long and costly legal action, and to assure quick payment for medical and  
hospital costs, loss of income, and other unavoidable costs stemming from automobile accidents. An injured person can  
collect from his or her insurance company up to the threshold level, or specified limit, no matter who is at fault. For  
expenses above these limits, the injured person is still allowed to sue. There are three types of thresholds: a specific  
dollar amount, a specific period of disability, or specified injuries such as loss of a leg.  
THRIFT PLAN type of employee savings plan under which an employee may contribute up to a specified percentage of  
the salary on an after-tax basis and the employer matches the employee's contribution up to a specified percentage.  
Investment earnings on the sums contributed accrue on a tax-deferred basis until distributed.

TICKET POLICY see TRANSPORTATION TICKET INSURANCE.  
TIME AND DISTANCE REINSURANCE type of EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE in which the insurance  
company (CEDENT) receives payments from its REINSURER in a specific pattern of payments.  
TIME ELEMENT (TIME POLICY) COVERAGE insurance that covers an INDIRECT LOSS stemming from a  
DIRECT LOSS by a covered peril to income-producing property. A building destroyed by fire represents a direct loss.  
Lost income resulting from the shutdown of a manufacturing facility housed in the burned building represents an  
indirect time element loss and would be covered by BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, a form of time  
element insurance.  
TIME FOR NOTIFICATION OF LOSS period allowed an insured to notify an insurer of loss. Many policies require  
immediate written notice, or notice as soon as practicable. Different types of policies have their own time periods. For  
example, health insurance policies require notice within 20 days, windstorm insurance policies within 10 days, and hail  
insurance policies within 48 hours. The purpose of a time period is to allow the insurer to investigate the loss and  
protect the property from further damage.  
TIME LIMIT  
1. part of the Model Uniform Life and Health Insurance Policy Provisions Law giving an insurer a time limit on  
contesting coverage for preexisting conditions or misrepresentation. This law, developed in 1950 as model legislation  
by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC), has been adopted by all states.  
While the model law gave insurers three years for certain defenses, such as misrepresentation of facts by an insured or  
nondisclosure of a preexisting condition, many states have lowered it to two years.  
2. period of time that proof of loss or claim must be filed with an insurance company.  
TIME LIMITS period of time during which notice of claim and proof of loss must be submitted by the INSURED or his  
or her legal representatives.  
TIME POLICY see TIME ELEMENT (TIME POLICY) COVERAGE; VOYAGE POLICY.  
TIME VALUE OF MONEY relationship determined by the mathematics of COMPOUND INTEREST between the  
value of a sum of money at one point in time and its value at another point in time. Time value of money can be  
illustrated by the fact that a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received a year from now because today's  
dollar can be invested and earn interest as the year elapses. Implicit in any consideration of time value of money are the  
rate of interest and the period of compounding. For example, the present value of $1 million  
< previous page page_521 next page >  
 
< previous page page_522 next page >  
Page 522  
received 10 years from now is only $386,000 today, assuming a 10% rate of interest and annual compounding.  
Insurance companies make use of time value of money by earning investment income on premiums between the time of  
receipt and the time of payment of claims or benefits. See also STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT.  
TITLE INSURANCE coverage for losses if a land title is not free and clear of defects that were unknown when the title  
insurance was written. Title insurance protects a purchaser if there is a defect in the title, such as a lien against the  
property, that is not discovered at the time of purchase. Although a title search is a routine part of a property transaction,  
it is possible that a search may overlook some encumbrance. Title insurance is written by title insurance companies that  
generally operate in a specific geographic area because of the need to examine local records. The TORRENS SYSTEM  
is a form of title insurance used in some states.  
TITLE XIX INSURANCE see MEDICAID.  
TLO see TOTAL LOSS ONLY (TLO) INSURANCE.  
TONTINE early life insurance that provided benefits only to survivors who lived to the end of a certain period of time.  
In the mid-17th century, Lorenzo Tonti, an Italian, devised a scheme to raise money for the French government of Louis  
XIV. It involved a state lottery in which the oldest survivor would collect the pot. One woman, age 96, hit the jackpot  
shortly before her death. Tontine policies were introduced in the U.S. in the 1860s, but condemned in the  
ARMSTRONG INVESTIGATION in 1905 in New York State and subsequently outlawed everywhere 45 years later.  
TOP HAT PLAN NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN for highly compensated employees or  
select group of personnel. The reporting and disclosure requirements of the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME  
SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) and the INTERNAL REVENUE CODE require only the following information:  
name of the employer, number of employees in the plan, and a statement from the employer that the plan is maintained  
and funded strictly to provide nonqualified deferred compensation to select number of personnel.  
TOP-HEAVY PLAN pension or other employee benefit plan that favors highly compensated employees or top  
executives or owners of a company. Prior to the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986, there was no uniform definition of a  
"highly compensated" employee, but that law provides a specific definition that is used for qualified pension plans, 401  
(k) plans, and some other employee benefits. An employee is considered highly compensated if he or she: (1) directly or  
indirectly owns more than a 5% interest in the company, (2) receives compensation from the company of more than  
$75,000, (3) is paid more than $50,000 and was among the top 20% of employees ranked by compensation, or (4) is at  
any time an officer and receives compensation that was more than 150% of the Section 415 defined-contribution dollar  
amount.

TORRENS SYSTEM means of land title registration used in some states that in effect, provides a government  
sponsored form of TITLE INSURANCE. Under this system, a government official, such as county recorder or county  
clerk, maintains Torrens System deed records and guarantees clear title when property is transferred. Fees charged for  
registration and transfer of title are used in part to finance a Torrens insurance fund in each jurisdiction to compensate  
claimants for damages resulting from errors.  
TORT in general, a civil wrong, other than breach of contract, for which a court will provide a remedy in the form of a  
suit for damages. Torts include negligent acts or omissions on the part of a defendant. Liability insurance is designed to  
cover an insured (defendant) for unintentional tort acts. See also NEGLIGENCE.  
TORT, DEFENSE AGAINST UNINTENTIONAL excuses raised by a defendant in a negligent suit (unintentional tort).  
There are three basic defenses to unintentional torts or negligence.  
1. ASSUMPTION OF RISKan individual (plaintiff), by not objecting to the negligent conduct of another, acknowledges  
awareness of the present danger and consents to it.  
2. CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCEboth individuals have contributed to an injury or property damage sustained by  
one or both individuals. Under this circumstance neither should be allowed to collect from the other.  
3. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCEwhere both plaintiff and defendant contributed to plaintiff's injury, the  
apportionment of some fault to the plaintiff reduces the liability of the defendant.  
TORT FEASOR person who commits a TORT, a type of wrongful act, that causes injury or damage.  
TORT, INTENTIONAL deliberate act or omission. These torts include trespassan individual enters property owned or  
in the possession of another without permission; conversionan individual exerts control and subverts another's property  
to his or her own benefit; assaultan individual's conduct causes another to fear for his or her life or the damage to his or  
her property; batteryan individual physically strikes another without permission; false imprisonmentan individual  
confines another illegally; libeldissemination of written injurious and false information about another's character; and  
slanderoral dissemination of injurious and false information about another's character.  
TORT LAW legislation governing wrongful acts, other than breaches of contract by one person against another or his or  
her property, for which civil action can be brought. Tort law and contract law define civil liability exposures. The four  
areas of torts are negligence, intentional interference, absolute liability, and strict liability. For example, the owner of a  
decrepit boat dock that collapses while people are standing on it might be liable under negligence. Assault and battery  
are an  
< previous page page_523 next page >  
 
< previous page page_524 next page >  
Page 524  
example of intentional interference. The owner of a poisonous snake that bit someone could be liable for injury under  
absolute liability, even if he or she did not intend to harm anyone. The maker of a defective product that harms the  
buyer might be held liable under strict liability. See also TORT LIABILITY.  
TORT LIABILITY see TORT; TORT, DEFENSE AGAINST UNINTENTIONAL; TORT, INTENTIONAL; TORT,  
UNINTENTIONAL.  
TORT, UNINTENTIONAL individual action or failure to act as a reasonably prudent person would under similar  
circumstances, resulting in harm to another. Also called NEGLIGENCE. A reasonably prudent person is defined by the  
standards of the profession that are followed, and the level of expertise expected of a person with like training. An  
example is a CPA who fails to complete tax returns on behalf of a client according to GENERALLY ACCEPTED  
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  
TOTAL DISABILITY see DISABILITY.  
TOTAL DISABILITY BENEFIT monthly income payment from a DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE policy made  
to the insured wage earner when income has been interrupted or terminated because of illness, sickness, or accident  
provided the following stipulations by the wage earner have been met: (1) total disability for the duration that the policy  
is in force and beyond the ELIMINATION PERIOD; and (2) while remaining totally disabled, income payment made at  
the end of each month until the limits on the maximum amount of benefit are reached, at which time payments will  
cease.  
TOTAL LOSS condition of real or personal property when it is damaged or destroyed to such an extent that it cannot be  
rebuilt or repaired to equal its condition prior to the loss.  
TOTAL OPERATING INCOME insurance company's total premium income plus investment income.  
TOTAL LOSS ONLY (TLO) INSURANCE ocean marine policy that pays an insured only if a ship or cargo is a total  
loss. Because total loss is rare, these policies are much less expensive than regular hull insurance. Therefore, it is used  
by shipowners who cannot afford more complete coverage or who cannot get it for some other reason.  
TOTAL RETURN comprehensive gain or loss on a security over a stipulated period of time comprised of capital  
appreciation plus dividend/interest received.  
TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT (TQM) management philosophy developed by W. Edwards Deming, the thesis of  
which is the continuous improvement in quality through research in customer satisfaction and the empowerment of  
employees. To that end, a range of team-building and work flow-analysis techniques are emphasized. This management  
technique is useful in its application to insurance  
< previous page page_524 next page >  
 
< previous page page_525 next page >  
Page 525  
company operations since these operations involve transactions between the company and customers to include policy  
sales, distribution, and claims. See also QUALITY INSURANCE CONGRESS (QIC).  
TOTAL RETURN UNITRUST (TRU) modification of the CHARITABLE REMAINDER UNITRUST through which  
the BENEFICIARIES receive a specified percentage of the assets' value in the TRUST usually paid out on a quarterly  
basis. If the trust's assets earn a greater return than the amount being received by the beneficiaries, the excess amount  
earned remains in the trust to further accumulate. As the assets grow in this trust, the income to the beneficiaries will  
also become larger.  
TOURIST BAGGAGE INSURANCE coverage for personal effects of a tourist, including apparel, books, toilet articles,  
watches, jewelry, luggage, portable typewriters, photographs and photography equipment and supplies. This is a  
SPECIFIED PERIL INSURANCE policy that specifically includes fire, lightning, damage due to automobile accident,  
theft of items in the care, custody, and control of a common carrier, and theft of items from the hotel room in which the  
insured tourist is registered. Excluded are baggage theft from checkrooms, baggage theft from hotel lobbies unless  
checked, items at the permanent premises of the insured tourist, and items that cannot be found but have not been stolen.  
TOWING INSURANCE endorsement to an automobile policy that pays specified amount for towing and related labor  
costs.  
TOWNHOUSE MULTIPLE LINE INSURANCE homeowners policy to cover the owner of a townhouse. See also  
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY.  
TRADITIONAL NET COST METHOD OF COMPARING COSTS see INTEREST ADJUSTED COST; LIFE  
INSURANCE COST.  
TRADITIONAL RISK REINSURANCE application of conventional terms and conditions to the REINSURANCE of a  
RISK. Contrast with NONTRADITIONAL REINSURANCE.  
TRAILER INSURANCE liability and physical damage coverage for trailers under business or personal auto policies.  
Most automobile insurance policies offer liability coverage for common types of trail-ers owned by an insured,  
including house trailers, boat trailers, and campers. For collision insurance coverage, personally owned trailers must be  
scheduled on a personal policy. The BUSINESS AUTOMOBILE POLICY (BAP) offers only limited insurance without  
scheduled coverage for both liability and collision.

TRANSFER FOR VALUE RULE an exception to SECTION 101 (A) (1) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE taxexempt  
status of the DEATH BENEFIT in a life insurance policy where the transfer of the interest in the policy by the  
policyowner to another party in exchange for a valuable consideration results in the death benefit losing its tax-exempt  
status. However, the death benefit will not lose its tax-exempt status when the policy is transferred to the insured, to a  
partner of the insured, to a partnership in which the insured is a full partner, or to a company, provided the insured is a  
stockholder and/or an officer in that company.  
TRANSFER OF INSUREDS provision in corporate life insurance policies that allows coverage to be transferred to a  
new individual with proof of insurability, for a premium appropriate to the age of the new individual. These policies are  
designed to cover key executives of a corporation and to provide continuous insurance in force without the necessity of  
obtaining a new policy. For example, if a corporation buys insurance to cover the chief executive officer who later  
retires, the policy could be transferred to the new CEO. See also RIDERS, LIFE INSURANCE.  
TRANSFER OF RISK see RISK TRANSFER.  
TRANSFER ON DEATH (TOD) form of stock ownership that permits the stockholder to select a BENEFICIARY to  
receive the stock upon the death of the stockholder. The stockholder retains all rights of stock ownership during his or  
her lifetime. At the death of the stockholder, the stock is transferred to the beneficiary not subject to PROBATE. The  
beneficiary can be a corporation, TRUST, or individual. The stockholder may nullify the TOD and change the  
beneficiary at will.  
TRANSFER PAYMENTS redistribution of wealth by taking money from one group of individuals and allocating that  
sum to another group of individuals. SOCIAL INSURANCE is such a mechanism, since the high-income group of  
individuals will pay proportionately more in Social Security taxes and receive proportionately less in retirement income  
benefits than the low-income group of individuals.  
TRANSIT INSURANCE INLAND MARINE policy that protects an insured against loss for property that is shipped.  
One policy may be written for a single shipment, as for a family moving household goods, or it may be an open policy  
written for a manufacturer who continuously ships products. The basic inland transit policy is written on one of two  
policy forms, the ANNUAL POLICY or the OPEN POLICY. TRIP TRANSIT INSURANCE is available for single  
shipments.

TRANSPLANT BENEFIT TOTAL DISABILITY BENEFIT in the form of a monthly income payment found in a  
disability income insurance policy to insured wage earners when their income has been interrupted or terminated due to  
total disability resulting from an organ transplant from the insured's body to the body of another individual.  
TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE see INLAND MARINE INSURANCE (TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE):  
BUSINESS RISKS.  
TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE RATING BUREAU (TIRB) one of two bureaus that writes forms and files  
standard rates for inland marine insurance. The other is the INLAND MARINE INSURANCE BUREAU.  
TRANSPORTATION TICKET INSURANCE accident policy that covers a traveler for a single trip on an airplane or  
other common carrier. The name comes from its origin as part of the ticket or ticket stub, but these policies are no  
longer sold with the ticket. They are commonly sold in airports, often from vending machines.  
TRAUMATIC INJURY bodily or emotional injury resulting from physical or mental wound or shock. A traumatic  
injury is caused by something outside the person's body as opposed to a sickness or a disease. An example would be  
injury to a hand that is smashed in a machine, or a nervous breakdown caused by stress on the job.  
TRAVEL ACCIDENT INSURANCE special-purpose health insurance policy that covers an insured for accidents while  
traveling. The policy may cover the insured for one specific trip or one particular type of travel, or it may cover all trips  
taken in a year. This type of insurance can be purchased in airport vending machines or from an agent.  
TRAVEL INSURANCE insurance coverage for pitfalls associated with travel. The coverage can be classified as  
follows:  
1. Trip Cancellationthe traveler(s) must cancel the trip because of unforeseen circumstances such as an illness;  
2. Trip Interruptioncoverage in the event a trip is terminated because of illness or hotel ceases to continue to operate;  
3. Lost Luggagevaluables are lost and expenses are incurred because of the inconvenience;  
4. Default Protectiona trip is cancelled because a carrier or tour operator is no longer in business.  
TREASURY INFLATION PROTECTION BONDS (TIPs) bonds issued by the United States Treasury that pay a  
semiannual interest rate tied to the Treasury auction plus an additional interest rate tied to the rate of inflation during  
this semiannual period. The rate of inflation is measured by the increases or decreases in the Consumer Price Index for  
Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The TIPs are issued in minimum denominations of $1000 with varying maturities. The  
additional rate of inflation interest adjustment is paid on the principal of the bond at maturity. Taxes are paid annually  
on both the interest earned on the TIP as well as the additional rate of inflation interest adjustment.

TREATY FACILITY facility used to gain access to the REINSURANCE markets by the CAPTIVE INSURANCE  
COMPANIES for their large property exposures. The facility reinsures a relatively small percentage of its captive  
company members' property exposure and uses a RETROCESSION to transfer the remainder of the property exposure  
on a TREATY REINSURANCE basis. The facility institutes all renewals of reinsurance for its captive company  
members at the same instance and arranges FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE for those members that cannot meet the  
UNDERWRITING requirements of the facility.

TRENDED describing the process of developing the ultimate losses and then adjusting them to the cost levels projected

TRESPASS see TORT, INTENTIONAL; TRESPASSER.  
TRESPASSER person who enters property without the right to do so. For liability purposes, it has been held that  
property owners are not responsible for trespassers as long as they do not intentionally trap or injure them. On the other  
hand, a property owner can be liable for injury to a person who has been invited onto his or her property, including  
messengers, delivery people, and service people, as well as guests. However, trespassers are very narrowly defined. No  
one in a public place is considered a trespasser. Likewise, owners of an ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE have been held  
liable for injuries to trespassing children. Further, recent interpretations by the courts have sometimes made owners  
liable for injury to trespassers if the owner was negligent.  
TRICARE Department of Defense TRIPLE OPTION managed health care program consisting of three options: Tricare  
Prime (HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION), Tricare Extra (PREFERRED PROVIDER  
ORGANIZATION), and Tricare Standard (non-network provider system). This program is designed to coordinate  
health care between the military and civilian systems for members of the military. Included is a program for resource  
sharing in order to increase the availability of health care services and to facilitate referral to the proper health providers.

TRIPLE OPTION PLAN plan that permits the insurance company to administer health care plans that permit the patient  
to choose from three benefit options at the time of need: INDEMNITY (insurance), HEALTH MAINTENANCE  
ORGANIZATION (HMO), and PREFERRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION (PPO). The indemnity plan, even  
though more costly, would provide the patient with the greatest number of choices among physicians and hospitals. The  
PPO would allow the patient to have more choices among physicians and hospitals than the HMO and would not require  
the patient to go through the primary care physician or gatekeeper, as the HMO requires. The HMO would be the lowest  
cost option (no deductible) but the most restrictive as to the patient's choice.  
TRIPLE PROTECTION combination life insurance policy consisting of ORDINARY LIFE and double the amount of  
TERM LIFE. Should the insured die within a stipulated time period, the double term amount and ordinary life amount  
are paid to the beneficiary. If the insured dies beyond the stipulated time period, only the ordinary amount is paid to the  
beneficiary. This policy may be applicable in situations where the family is young and extra amounts of protection are  
required until the children reach the age of majority.  
TRIP TRANSIT INSURANCE coverage on a single shipment of property while in temporary storage or in transit. This  
policy is most commonly used in moving of household goods, which are covered from the time they are picked up, put  
in temporary storage, shipped to another location and put in temporary storage, and then delivered to the insured's new  
address. Protection is on an ALL RISKS basis subject to exclusions such as war, wear and tear, and nuclear disaster.  
TRUCKERS INSURANCE limited special purposes policy that provides liability and physical damage insurance for  
owners and opera-tors of trucks while engaged in business. This insurance is often purchased by a business that employs  
owner-operators.  
TRUE GROUP PLAN insurance arrangement in which all employees of a given business firm are accepted into a plan  
regardless of their physical condition. The employee cannot be required to take a physical examination in order to  
qualify. The employees are covered under a Master Contract. See also GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE; GROUP  
LIFE INSURANCE.  
TRUE NO-FAULT AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE see NO-FAULT AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE.  
TRUST legal entity that provides for ownership of property by one person for the benefit of another. The TRUSTEE  
receives title to the property, but does not have the right to benefit personally from that property. The trustee has a legal  
obligation to manage the property and invest its assets solely for the BENEFICIARY OF TRUST. Since the trustee is  
required to manage the property and its assets in a prudent manner,  
< previous page page_529 next page >  
 
< previous page page_530 next page >  
Page 530  
if the trustee fails to perform in accordance with the PRUDENT MAN RULE the trustee becomes personally  
responsible for any lost funds or profits incurred by the trust. There are basically two types of trusts: LIVING TRUST  
(established during the life of the GRANTOR) and TESTAMENTARY TRUST. For example, a trust may be  
established by a parent to hold assets for the benefit of a child. See also BENEFICIARY OF TRUST; ESTATE

TRUST FUND PLAN one of two basic types of funding instruments for pensions or employee benefits, in which  
responsibility for plan assets is vested in a trustee. The other type is known as an insured plan, whose assets are held by  
a life insurance company, typically under a group annuity contract that guarantees payment of benefits. A

an insurance company. See also SELF-ADMINISTERED PLAN.

TRUTH-IN-SAVINGS ACT act passed by Congress in 1991, the purpose of which is to make it easier for consumers to  
compare deposit accounts among savings institutions (SI). Some of the act's more important provisions include: (1) SI  
must pay interest on the full amount of a depositor's balance; (2) SI must use a standardized formula for computing the  
annual percentage yield (APY). The APY is based on the interest rate and the method of compounding that interest; (3)  
SI must disclose all fees imposed on checking, savings, money market, or Super NOW accounts as well as any other  
terms or restrictions. These disclosures are required before the account is opened, before automatic renewals, or upon  
the request of the savings customer. The savings institution must inform current savings account customers of the  
availability of the disclosures and include these disclosures with the savings customer's regular account statement; and  
(4) SI must be in compliance with standardized rules concerning their promotional activities for advertising. All  
solicitations (whether in print, TV, radio, etc.) for savings deposits must state in a clear and conspicuous manner: (1)  
annual percentage yield; (2) period of time that the yield is in effect; (3) minimum account balance required to earn the  
yield; (4) minimum time period required to earn the yield; (5) minimum amount required to open the account; (6)  
interest penalty is required for early withdrawals; (7) and the fact that fees may result in the reduction of the Annual  
Percentage Yield.  
TUITION FEES INSURANCE indemnification of a school for the loss of tuition, and room and board fees when it is  
forced to suspend classes because of the occurrence of a peril. See also TUITION FORM.  
TUITION FORM coverage in the event a school, summer camp, or similar operation suffers loss of tuition because a  
peril destroys a building. The tuition form reimburses the institution for loss of tuition and rental income from room and  
board. See also TUITION FEES INSURANCE.  
TUNNEL INSURANCE coverage in the event a tunnel is damaged or destroyed. Written on an ALL RISKS basis,  
excluding perils of war, wear and tear, inherent defect, and nuclear damage. For example, this coverage would be  
important to businesses that have underground tunnels connecting different locations.  
TURNKEY INSURANCE Contractor's and Architect's Errors and Omissions Insurance, which also serves as a general  
liability policy for these professionals.  
TURNOVER RATE frequency with which employees resign, are fired, or retire from a company, usually computed as  
the percentage of an organization's employees at the beginning of a calendar year. The turnover rate is one of the factors  
affecting the cost of a pension plan. Employees who leave a company before they have a vested interest in the plan  
represent a cost saving to plan administrators, because they will not receive benefits when they retire. For this reason,  
most actuaries  
< previous page page_531 next page >  
 
< previous page page_532 next page >  
Page 532  
make assumptions about the turnover rate of a particular company when calculating how much money must be  
contributed to a retirement plan to pay future benefits.  
TWISTING UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE, in insurance, whereby an agent or broker attempts to persuade a life  
insurance policyholder through misrepresentation to cancel one policy and buy a new one. Some states have laws  
requiring full disclosure of relevant comparative information about existing and proposed policies by an agent trying to  
convince a customer to switch policies. These laws may provide for notification of the insurance company that issued  
the existing policy to give it an opportunity to respond to the agent's proposal.

are entered into by all parties in good faith, meaning that they have disclosed all relevant facts and intend to carry out  
their obligations. Where lack of good faith can be proved, such as in a fraudulent application to obtain insurance, the  
contract may be nullified.

ULTIMATE MORTALITY TABLE presentation of data that excludes the first 5 to 10 years of experience of those who  
purchase life insurance. A MORTALITY TABLE shows the number of deaths per 1000 of a group of people.  
Experience shows that people have a lower mortality rate in the first years after they have purchased insurance,  
probably because they have recently passed a medical and other tests. A SELECT MORTALITY TABLE includes data  
only on people who have recently purchased insurance. An aggregate mortality table includes all data.  
ULTIMATE NET LOSS insurer's total payments resulting from a claim, including all related expenses, less any  
recoveries from salvage, reinsurance, and the exercise of subrogation rights or other rights against third parties. See also  
LOSS DEVELOPMENT.  
ULTRA VIRES Latin phrase meaning "beyond power or authority" describing an act by a corporation that exceeds its  
legal powers. For example, corporations do not have the authority to engage in the insurance business without a charter.  
A corporation offering insurance without authority would be acting ultra vires. Similarly, an insurance company  
chartered to engage in a single line of business would be operating ultra vires by offering some other line.  
UMBRELLA LIABILITY INSURANCE excess liability coverage above the limits of a basic business liability  
insurance policy such as the OWNERS, LANDLORDS AND TENANTS LIABILITY POLICY. For example, if a basic  
policy has a limit of $500,000, and it is exhausted by claims, the umbrella will pay the excess above $500,000 up to the  
limit of the umbrella policy, which may be as high as $10,000,000, $25,000,000 or more. The umbrella policy also fills  
gaps in coverage under basic liability policies.  
UMBRELLA REINSURANCE protection for all classes of business including automobile, fire, general liability,  
homeowners, multiple peril, burglary, and glass, by combining the contracts for these classes of business into one  
reinsurance contract. This enables the cedant to  
< previous page page_533 next page >  
 
< previous page page_534 next page >  
Page 534  
obtain reinsurance more cheaply, with greater capacity, and with greater spread of risk. An umbrella reinsurance  
contract is offered to one set of reinsurers who all take a fixed percentage of every treaty in the contract. One reinsurer  
may take 5% across the board, another may take 10%, and so on, until the umbrella contract is totally placed. All the  
treaties that compose the umbrella contract are written as one block of business; hence, the reinsurers are prohibited  
from choosing which treaty they want to reinsure. By combining all the reinsurance treaties into one contract, if a  
catastrophe loss results, each reinsurer will assume only a percentage of the loss instead of assuming the entire loss by  
itself.  
UMPIRE arbitrator who settles disputes over the amount of loss when an insurer and an insured do not agree.  
UMPIRE CLAUSE see ARBITRATION CLAUSE.  
UNALLOCATED BENEFIT see UNALLOCATED FUNDING INSTRUMENT.  
UNALLOCATED FUNDING INSTRUMENT pension funding agreement under which funds paid into a retirement  
plan are not currently allocated to purchase retirement benefits. The funds of one plan cannot be commingled with funds  
of another plan, and the plan trustee guarantees neither principal nor interest of the funds deposited. At retirement the  
trustee can either purchase an immediate retirement annuity for the retiring employee or pay the benefits directly from  
the fund as they become due. See also PENSION PLAN FUNDING: GROUP DEPOSIT ADMINISTRATION

UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW act of practicing law or providing legal advice without a license.  
UNAUTHORIZED REINSURANCE REINSURANCE ceded to an insurance company that is a NONADMITTED  
INSURER.  
UNBUNDLED term that describes commercial insurance with no administrative services attached, or alternatively,  
administrative services from an insurer without insurance coverage. Years ago, insureds bought a package that included  
coverage for exposures as well as claims paying, loss control, and other risk management services. With the increasing  
sophistication of risk management in the past decade, and to reduce their costs, many corporations elect to perform  
some of  
< previous page page_534 next page >

these duties themselves and to purchase insurance and other services on an unbundled basis.  
UNBUNDLED LIFE INSURANCE POLICY coverage in which the investment features, mortality element, and cost  
factors of a LIFE INSURANCE policy are separated, permitting each part to be independently analyzed. The SAVINGS  
ELEMENT of the policy then becomes interest-sensitive (rate of return paid to the POLICYHOLDER is more  
consistent with the rate of returns earned by the life insurance company over a period of time than is the rate of return  
paid to the holder of a traditional life insurance policy). See also UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE.  
UNCONDITIONAL VESTING no limitation under a CONTRIBUTORY pension plan of an employee's right to receive

UNDERWRITER SYNDICATE see LLOYD'S OF LONDON.  
UNDERWRITING process of examining, accepting, or rejecting insurance risks, and classifying those selected, in order  
to charge the proper premium for each. The purpose of underwriting is to spread the risk among a pool of insureds in a  
manner that is equitable for the insureds and profitable for the insurer. See also RISK MANAGEMENT; RISK  
SELECTION.  
UNDERWRITING CYCLE tendency of property and liability insurance premiums, insurers' profits, and availability of  
coverage to rise and fall with some regularity over time. A cycle can be said to begin when insurers tighten their  
underwriting standards and sharply raise premiums after a period of severe underwriting losses. Stricter standards and  
higher premium rates often bring dramatic increases in profits, attracting more capital to the insurance industry and  
raising underwriting capacity. On the other hand, as insurers strive to write more premiums at higher levels of  
profitability, premium rates may be driven down and underwriting standards relaxed in the competition for new  
business. Profits may erode and then turn into losses if more tax underwriting standards generate mounting claims. The  
stage would then be set for the cycle to begin again.  
UNDERWRITING EXPENSES salaries plus commissions plus over-head expenses plus office rent plus fees charged  
for memberships in industry associations and bureaus plus guaranty association assessments plus taxes (not including  
federal income taxes, foreign income taxes, and real estate taxes).  
UNDERWRITING FACTORS: HEALTH INSURANCE factors on the APPLICATION that must be evaluated in order  
to complete the UNDERWRITING PROCESS: age; sex; physical condition; personal health history; family health  
history; financial condition; use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco; occupation; avocation; and if in the military.  
UNDERWRITING FACTORS: LIFE INSURANCE factors on the APPLICATION that must be evaluated in order to

health history; (6) financial condition; (7) use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco; (8) occupation; (9) avocation; (10) and if in  
the military.  
UNDERWRITING GAIN (LOSS) profit (deficit) that remains after paying claims and expenses. Insurers generate  
profits from underwriting and from investment income. Their chief business is insuring against risks for a profit, and  
one measure of success is whether there is money left after paying claims and expenses. This amount, if any, is their  
underwriting gain. See also COMBINED RATIO.

UNEARNED PREMIUM see UNEARNED PREMIUM INSURANCE; UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVE;  
UNEARNED REINSURANCE PREMIUM.  
UNEARNED PREMIUM INSURANCE coverage for loss of unearned premium if insured property is destroyed before  
the end of a policy period. The policyholder pays in advance for insurance, but the insurer does not earn the premium  
until coverage is provided. For example, if a policy period is one year, one-twelfth of the premium is earned each  
month. After six months, one-half of the premium is still unearned and belongs to the policyholder if the policy is  
canceled. If the property is destroyed in the second month and the insurer pays the claim, the policyholder would have  
nothing left to insure. Unearned premium insurance reimburses the insured for the part of the premium paid up front  
that is no longer needed for insurance coverage.  
UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVE fund that contains the portion of the premium that has been paid in advance for  
insurance that has not yet been provided. For example, if a business pays an annual premium of $1000 on January 1, the  
money is not earned by the insurer until the insurance coverage has been provided. On July 1, $500 would have been  
earned and $500 would remain as unearned premium, belonging to the policyholder. If either party cancels the contract,  
the insurer must have the unearned premium ready to refund. For this reason, insurance regulators require that insurers  
maintain an unearned premium reserve so that, in the event an insurer must be liquidated, there is enough money to pay  
claims and refund the unearned premium. Because computations for individual policies would be cumbersome,  
regulators have devised formulas for figuring unearned premium reserves. See also REINSURANCE RESERVE  
(UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVE).  
UNEARNED REINSURANCE PREMIUM portion of reinsurance premium received by the reinsurer that relates to the  
unexpired part of the reinsured policy. See also AUTOMATIC PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE; FACULTATIVE  
REINSURANCE; NONPROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE; PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE; REINSURANCE.  
UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION money paid through state and federal programs to workers who are  
temporarily unemployed. The program, which was created by the SOCIAL SECURITY ACT OF 1935, is  
< previous page page_537 next page >  
 
< previous page page_538 next page >  
Page 538  
managed by the individual states, which decide the level of benefits that will be paid and assess a payroll tax on  
employers to pay for the program. Employers may pay more or less tax depending on the stability of their workforces.  
Weekly benefits vary widely among the states.  
UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AMENDMENT OF 1992 amendment to the law that requires companies that  
manage retirement plans to permit terminating participants to directly transfer any plan distribution to the  
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) or QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN of the participant's choice. If the  
participant receives the distribution directly, the plan administrator is required to remit a 20% withholding penalty  
directly to the Internal Revenue Service. See also ROLLOVER AND WITHHOLDING RULES FOR QUALIFIED  
PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS; ROLLOVER AND WITHHOLDING RULES FOR QUALIFIED PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS:  
PAYMENT PAID TO EMPLOYEE.  
UNFAIR CLAIMS PRACTICE abuse by an insurer in an effort to avoid paying a claim filed by an insured, or to reduce  
the size of the payment. The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) has  
developed model legislation requiring that claims be handled fairly and that there be free communication between  
policyholder and insurer. Many states have adopted unfair claims practice laws.  
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE in insurance, fraudulent or unethical practice that is illegal under state law. States may  
fine or revoke the licenses of agents and brokers for unfair trade practices, including misrepresentation, false  
advertising, misappropriation of policy-holder's money, and TWISTING. Many states have adopted the NAIC model  
Unfair Trade Practices Act.

UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE standardized set of business laws that has been adopted by most states. The  
Uniform Commercial Code governs a wide range of transactions including borrowing, contracts, and many other  
everyday business practices. It is useful because it standardizes practices from state to state.  
UNIFORM FORMS widely accepted standard policy forms that have been developed by various RATING BUREAUS  
or insurance companies. Some forms are required by state law, and some are used by custom. In some cases provisions  
are mandated, but a form is not. Even so, many companies use the same forms, which become widely recognized as the  
standard for certain types of risk.  
UNIFORM GIFTS TO MINORS ACT act in which an irrevocable gift is made by the parent to the child. For children  
less than age 14, the first $600 of annual investment earnings is tax free and the next $600 is taxed at the child's 15% tax  
rate. If the child is at least age 14, all  
< previous page page_538 next page >  
 
< previous page page_539 next page >  
Page 539  
income is taxed at the child's rate. Once the child reaches the age of majority, which in most states is 18 or 21, the child  
can use the money in that account as desired.  
UNIFORM INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS POLICY PROVISIONS ACT regulations of the  
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) that dictate provisions that all individual  
health insurance policies must contain. All states now require these provisions, which include the circumstances under  
which changes can be made to the policy; how the BENEFICIARY can be changed; submission of PROOF OF LOSS;  
REINSTATEMENT of the policy; and GRACE PERIOD.  
UNIFORM POLICY PROVISIONS, HEALTH INSURANCE basic contract language in individual health and accident  
insurance policies. These provisions are required under a model state law known as the UNIFORM INDIVIDUAL  
ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS POLICY PROVISIONS ACT. The uniform provisions, some mandatory and some  
optional under the model act, deal with such questions as proof of loss, medical examination, claims notice, claims  
forms, policy renewal, and premium grace period. The act does not require companies to adopt exact wording in their  
policies but to substantially follow the provision guidelines.  
UNIFORM PROVISIONS language adopted by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) and recommended or required by state law. While they rarely dictate the language of  
policies, states often prescribe mandatory or optional policy minimums, or may forbid certain provisions. Therefore,  
while life and health benefits may vary widely, for example, policyholders are given certain uniform rights, like grace  
periods for paying premiums and loan and surrender values.  
UNIFORM RECIPROCAL LICENSING ACT law by which many states attempt to regulate insurers who are  
unlicensed in those states. With a few notable exceptions, such as reinsurers, insurance companies must be licensed in  
the states where they do business. If a U.S. insurer sells insurance in a state where it is unauthorized, the insurer's home  
state may revoke its license under the Uniform Reciprocal Licensing Act.  
UNIFORM SIMULTANEOUS DEATH ACT statute in most states under which, if no evidence exists in a common  
disaster (when an insured and beneficiary die within a short time of each other in an accident for which determination  
cannot be made as to who died first), the presumption is that the insured survived the beneficiary and the life insurance  
proceeds will either be paid to a secondary beneficiary (if named in a policy) or, if not named, then to the insured's  
estate.

the DEATH BENEFIT from the policy to the custodian of a minor BENEFICIARY provided the beneficiary  
designation has specifically nominated the custodian to receive the death benefit on behalf of the minor.  
UNILATERAL CONTRACT legal agreement in which only one of the two parties makes legally enforceable promises.  
An insurance contract is a unilateral contract because only the insurer has made a promise of future performance and  
only the insurer can be charged with breach of contract. In contrast, in a bilateral contract, both parties promise future  
performance.

as substandard or uninsurable.  
UNISEX LEGISLATION regulations affecting the right of insurance companies to use sex as one of the factors in the  
actuarial determination of premium rates. The precedent case for such legislation is Arizona Governing Committee v.  
Norris in which the decision was that a municipal retirement plan could not provide retirement benefits based on sex.  
UNIT BENEFIT see DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN; UNIT BENEFIT PLAN.  
UNIT BENEFIT APPROACH see DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.  
UNIT BENEFIT PLAN retirement plan under which a discrete increment of periodic retirement income is credited to an  
employee for each year of service with an employer. This increment is either a flat dollar amount or, more often, a  
percentage of compensation. If percentage of compensation is credited, it generally is 1 1/4 2 1/2%. At retirement, years  
of service are multiplied by percentage of compensation. The resulting percentage is applied to the employee's final  
average or career average of earnings. For example, if an employee has 30 years of service, a final average earnings of  
$100,000, and the percentage of compensation is 1 1/2%, the employee's annual retirement benefit would be $45,000  
($30 x $100,000 x .015). See also DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.

UNIVERSAL LIFE II see UNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE ADJUSTABLE LIFE INSURANCE under which (1) premiums are flexible, not  
fixed; (2) protection is adjustable, not fixed; and (3) insurance company expenses and other charges are specifically  
disclosed to a purchaser. This policy is referred to as unbundled life insurance because its three basic elements  
(investment earnings, pure cost of protection, and company expenses) are separately identified both in the policy and in  
an annual report to the policyowner. After the first premium, additional premiums can be paid at any time. (There  
usually are limits on the dollar amount of each additional payment.) A specified percentage expense charge is deducted  
from each premium before the balance is credited to the cash value, along with interest. The pure cost of protection is  
subtracted from the cash value monthly. As selected by the insured, the death benefit can be a specified amount plus the  
cash value or the specified amount that includes the cash value. After payment of the minimal initial premium required,  
there are no contractually scheduled premium payments (provided the cash value account balance is sufficient to pay the  
pure cost of protection each month and any other expenses and charges. Expenses and charges may take the form of a  
< previous page page_541 next page >  
 
< previous page page_542 next page >  
Page 542  
flat dollar amount for the first policy year, a sales charge for each premium received, and a monthly expense charge for  
each policy year). An annual report is provided the policy owner that shows the status of the policy (death benefit option  
selected, specified amount of insurance in force, cash value, surrender value, and the transactions made each month  
under the policy during the yearpremiums received, expenses charged, guaranteed and excess interest credited to the  
cash value account, pure cost of insurance deducted, and cash value balance). See also UNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE  
INSURANCE.  
UNIVERSAL VARIABLE see UNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
UNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE policy combining features of UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE and  
VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE in that excess interest credited to the cash value account depends on investment  
results of separate accounts (equities, bonds, real estate, etc.). The policyowner selects the accounts into which the  
premium payments are to be made. However, since this is an EQUITY product, filing with the SECURITIES AND  
EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), an annual prospectus, an audit of separate accounts, and agent registration with  
the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS (NASD) are required. This policy can be considered a  
replacement for universal life insurance when interest rates of U.S. Treasury issues and other money market instruments  
are low. Contrast with UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE.  
UNLIMITED MARITAL DEDUCTION deduction allowed for gifts and bequests to a spouse for federal estate and gift  
tax purposes. Under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA), the deduction became unlimited. Prior to this,  
there was a dollar and percentage limitation for the marital deduction.  
UNOCCUPANCY absence of people for at least 60 consecutive days from a given property. Many property insurance  
policies suspend coverage after a structure has been unoccupied for 60 consecutive days because the probability of loss  
increases dramatically from such perils as vandalism and malicious mischief. Premiums for these policies were based on  
statements of an insured that the structure would be occupied. Unoccupancy results in an increase in hazards within the  
control of an insured, which gives the insurance company the right to suspend the policy. See also VACANCY.  
UNREALIZED CAPITAL GAINS (LOSSES) appreciation in the unsold assets' value. When assets are sold, their  
capital gain (loss) is shown on the insurance company's income statement; any unrealized gain or loss is not included  
within the income statement.  
UNREPORTED CLAIMS see INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED LOSSES (IBNR).

of automobile accidents. The claimants must prove that they were not at fault and that they cannot collect damages from  
the drivers who hit them. The responsible drivers then lose their licenses until they reimburse the fund.  
UNSCHEDULED PROPERTY FLOATER insurance that offers blanket coverage up to a certain dollar amount on all  
property of the classification covered by the policy. Floater policies, which cover property wherever it happens to be  
and while it is in transit, can also be purchased as a SCHEDULED POLICY where each individual item is listed.  
UNSOLICITED APPLICATION request for life insurance coverage by an individual, not through an agent or broker. It  
is given extra scrutiny by an insurance company because of the possibility of SELF-SELECTION, which is the  
likelihood that poorer risks will seek insurance on their own initiative. See also ADVERSE SELECTION; RISK  
SELECTION.  
UNVALUED MARINE POLICY coverage that does not put a dollar value on a hull or cargo that is insured. A valued  
marine policy puts a specific value on the insured property. With unvalued property, the value is determined at the time  
of loss.  
UPSTREAM HOLDING COMPANY holding company formed by at least one stock insurance company. This holding  
company is owned by its stockholders and is usually listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. In turn,  
the holding company owns 100% of the stock of the subsidiary insurance companies.  
URBAN DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1970 law that provided for federal crime insurance. Because private insurance is  
not available for business owners and residents of certain high-crime areas, the act provides that the FEDERAL  
INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION write the coverage. Private insurers service the program.  
USE AND OCCUPANCY INSURANCE type of BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE that provides indirect  
loss coverage by endorsement to BOILER AND MACHINERY INSURANCE. The latter, sometimes called POWER  
PLANT INSURANCE, provides for both direct and indirect loss coverage. Direct loss would indemnify an insured for  
damage to property. Use and occupancy insurance covers an insured for loss of use of the equipment due to damage  
from a named peril.

UTILIZATION measurement of the use of health insurance by employees of an insured employer, stated in terms of the

UTILITY quality of being useful. Risk diminishes maximum utility in society because resources gravitate to activities,  
businesses, and investments that are least risky. By absorbing or protecting against some risks, insurance increases  
utility. When individuals know they will have some cushion against loss, their assets can be spread out over a greater  
range of activities and enterprises.  
UTILIZATION REVIEW (UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT) integral part of MANAGED CARE health plans

The same stipulations apply to property coverages as found in unoccupancy. See also UNOCCUPANCY.  
VALIDATION PERIOD length of time required to amortize the excess expenses of acquiring a given group of life  
insurance policies. In acquiring a policy, a life insurance company may incur expenses (such as the costs of sales  
commissions, paperwork, and medical examinations) that are greater than the amount allocated for LOADING in the  
first year's premium. In effect, this means new policies are acquired at a loss, forcing insurers to dip into surplus to add  
the new business. After the first year, because expenses are lower, premiums and their invested earnings begin to  
generate a contribution to surplus, gradually making up for the excess expense of the first year. The length of the  
validation period depends on many factors, including the levels of GROSS PREMIUMS and expenses, but in some  
companies validation periods can extend for 10 years or more.  
VALID CONTRACT agreement signed by both parties that meets the requirements of state law and is therefore in force.  
VALUABLE PAPERS (RECORDS) INSURANCE coverage in the event that papers of intrinsic value are damaged or  
destroyed. Coverage is on an ALL RISKS basis. Limits of coverage can be quite high; but the insurance company will  
not pay an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the loss, or the amount necessary to repair or replace the  
damaged or destroyed papers. Also, the papers must be kept under lock and key.  
VALUATION  
1. method of determining the worth of property to be insured, or of property that has been lost or damaged.  
2. method of setting insurance company reserves to pay future claims.  
VALUATION CLAUSE provision in a MARINE INSURANCE policy in which agreement has been reached between  
the insured and the insurance company concerning the worth of the property that is to be covered under the policy.  
VALUATION FACTORS, PENSION PLANS see PENSION PLAN VALUATION FACTORS.  
VALUATION METHOD means of determining that a loss has occurred and setting an economic value on it so that a  
claim can be paid. When an insured suffers a loss, an adjuster must determine that it actually occurred, that it was  
covered by insurance, and the value of the lost or damaged property. The adjuster, with the help of the insured, deter-  
< previous page page_545 next page >  
 
< previous page page_546 next page >  
Page 546  
mines the cost to repair or replace the covered property. The adjuster computes actual cash value, or replacement cost,  
minus depreciation. For indirect losses, such as business interruption, the adjuster must make rough estimates, and then  
must consider COINSURANCE and adjust claims payments for it.  
VALUATION MORTALITY TABLE MORTALITY TABLE used to calculate the LEGAL RESERVE and life  
insurance policy CASH SURRENDER VALUES.  
VALUATION OF ASSETS rules by state insurance regulators for valuing ADMITTED ASSETS on the books of  
insurance companies. Part of the STATE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION of insurers is the determination of  
which assets''admitted assets"are allowed to back STATUTORY RESERVES. Admitted assets include real estate,  
mortgages, securities, cash, and bank deposits. Mortgage loans, cash, and bank deposits are recognized at face value.  
Real estate is allowed at book value. Securities are carried according to SECURITY VALUATION rules. Bonds with  
acceptable credit quality are carried at amortized value, which is the face value plus or minus the amount of any  
purchase discount or premium, as amortized over the life of the bond. Preferred stock is valued at cost and COMMON  
STOCK INVESTMENTS at year-end market price. Valuations for impaired securities such as bonds in default are  
determined by the Committee on Valuation of Securities of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE  
COMMISSIONERS (NAIC). See also MANDATORY SECURITIES VALUATION RESERVE.  
VALUATION OF LOSS method of setting a dollar value on loss suffered by an insured. In some cases, a loss is  
straightforward, such as the cost of gallbladder surgery. But with burglary of a home or a traffic accident that damages a  
car, the amount of loss is open to interpretation. In many cases, the insured needs receipts, appraisal documents, or other  
evidence of value. In other cases, a claim adjuster values the loss and determines how much the insurer will pay.  
VALUATION OF POTENTIAL PROPERTY LOSS risk management technique that evaluates property exposures  
preparatory to managing the risk. Although risk managers consider the ORIGINAL COST, DEPRECIATION, market  
value, and TAX-APPRAISED VALUE of property, replacement cost is the most helpful in determining the value of the  
property, giving the truest indication of the degree of the exposure to be insured or otherwise financed.  
VALUATION PERIOD for a VARIABLE ANNUITY, the period of time from the close of business on the first  
BUSINESS DAY to the close of business on the second business day.  
VALUATION PREMIUM life insurance rate determined by the valuation of company policy reserves. State regulators  
set strict standards for policy reserves to make certain that life insurers will have enough assets to make good on their  
policies. Once the reserves are valued, the  
< previous page page_546 next page >  
 
< previous page page_547 next page >  
Page 547  
company works backward to set a valuation premium that will cover all of its liabilities. However, some companies  
determine that they can justify setting a GROSS PREMIUM that is lower than the valuation premium because their  
experience, based on updated mortality tables, is better than that used to determine the valuation premium. If they do  
charge a premium that is lower, they are required to deposit the difference in a DEFICIENCY RESERVE.  
VALUATION RESERVE (SECURITIES VALUATION RESERVE) amount set up as a cushion against fluctuations in  
securities prices. See also MANDATORY VALUATION SECURITIES RESERVE.

VALUED agreement by an insurance company to pay a predetermined amount, as indicated in an insurance policy,  
should a loss occur.  
VALUED BASIS INDEMNIFICATION benefit found in a DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE policy that  
endeavors to replace the insured wage earner's income with a monetary sum equal to the actual lost income terminated  
because of illness, sickness, or accident.  
VALUED CLAUSE provision in an insurance policy that states the monetary value of each piece of property to be  
insured.  
VALUED CONTRACT see VALUED POLICY.  
VALUED FORM see VALUED POLICY.  
VALUED MARINE POLICY see VALUED POLICY.  
VALUED POLICY policy that pays a specified sum not related in any way to the extent of the loss. The term applies to  
a life insurance policy rather than to a contract of indemnity because the former does not purport to restore an insured  
(or beneficiary) to the same financial position after a loss as prior to the loss. The sum of money that a life insurance  
policy pays as a death benefit is a definite amount that may or may not have any relation to the quantitative value of the  
death. Thus, the life insurance policy is deemed to be a valued policy.  
VALUED POLICY LAW legislation in a number of states requiring insurers to pay the FACE AMOUNT of a fire  
insurance policy in case of total loss to a dwelling (or sometimes another specified type of building), rather than the  
ACTUAL CASH VALUE of the loss. Such laws in effect override the principle of INDEMNITY that normally governs  
property and liability insurance contracts.  
VALUE REPORTING FORM form that provides coverage for a business whose inventory has fluctuating values  
during the year. The amount of insurance coverage is adjusted monthly, quarterly, or annually to reflect the changing  
monetary value of the inventory. The use  
< previous page page_547 next page >  
 
< previous page page_548 next page >  
Page 548  
of this FORM should eliminate the problem of overinsurance as well as underinsurance.  
VALUES see NONFORFEITABILITY; NONFORFEITURE BENEFIT (OPTION); NONFORFEITURE PROVISION.  
VANDALISM AND MALICIOUS MISCHIEF INSURANCE coverage usually written as an endorsement to property  
policies such as the Standard Fire Policy. A loss must be by the intentional acts of vandals. This peril is of particular  
importance to owners of structures that are not occupied during particular periods during the day, such as schools and  
churches. Vandals have little risk of being caught during these periods, when they are most likely to strike. Because of  
high frequency, a high deductible is usually required when insuring churches and schools.  
VANDALISM ENDORSEMENT see VANDALISM AND MALICIOUS MIS-CHIEF INSURANCE.  
VANISHING PREMIUM (PREMIUM OFFSET) life insurance policy under which there is rapid buildup of cash values  
due to high initial premiums such that after a given point in time no further premium payments are required (future  
premium payments are borrowed from the cash value).  
VANISHING PREMIUM OPTION see VANISHING PREMIUM PROVISION.  
VANISHING PREMIUM PROVISION CLAUSE in a life insurance policy that states that once the CASH VALUE  
exceeds the NET SINGLE PREMIUM (based on current interest and mortality rates) required for the policy to become  
PAID-UP INSURANCE, the POLICYOWNER may elect not to make further premium payments. If the CASH  
VALUE falls below the amount necessary to fund the net single premium, additional premium payments are required.  
See also VANISHING PREMIUM.  
VARIABLE ANNUITIES see VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY.  
VARIABLE BENEFIT PLAN see VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY; VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY annuity in which premium payments are used to purchase accumulation units, their  
number depending on the value of each unit. The value of a unit is determined by the value of the portfolio of stocks in  
which the insurance company invests the premiums.  
At the time of the payment of benefits to the annuitant, the accumulation units are converted to a monthly fixed number  
of units. The variable element is the dollar value of each unit. For example, assume that the annuitant pays a monthly  
premium of $100. If the accumulation unit value during one month is $50, two units are purchased. In another month, if  
the value of the accumulation unit is $25, four units are purchased. In a third month, the value of the unit is $10,  
resulting  
< previous page page_548 next page >  
 
< previous page page_549 next page >  
Page 549  
in the purchase of 10 units. This allows the market use of the investment strategy of dollar cost averaging.  
Accumulation units are credited to the annuitant's account, a procedure that is similar to purchasing shares in a mutual  
fund.  
When income benefits are scheduled to begin, total accumulation units are converted to assume 100 income benefit  
units per month. The value of the income unit will vary according to the company's stock investments; in one month the  
annuitant's income might be $1000, in another month $500, in another month $1200. Changes in the investment  
experience by the insurance company are passed on to the annuitant, but the company absorbs fluctuations in expenses  
and mortality experience. See also ANNUITY.  
VARIABLE DOLLAR INVESTMENTS financial instruments whose principal and income are not established in  
advance according to contractual terms set forth in the financial instruments document. Both the principal and income  
can fluctuate according to the up and down swings in the value of an underlying portfolio. Examples of such  
investments include stocks, mutual funds, real estate, VARIABLE ANNUITIES, VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE, and  
UNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE.  
VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE investment-oriented whole life insurance policy that provides a return linked to an  
underlying portfolio of securities. The portfolio typically is a group of mutual funds established by the insurer as a  
separate account, with the policyholder given some investment discretion in choosing the mix of assets among, say, a  
common stock fund, a bond fund, and a money market fund. Variable life insurance offers fixed premiums and a  
minimum death benefit. The better the total return on the investment portfolio, the higher the death benefit or surrender  
value of the variable life policy. See also INDEXED LIFE INSURANCE.  
VARIABLE LIMIT in property insurance coverages, provision whereby the limit of the policy automatically increases  
at each policy anniversary date, subject to the insured's rejection of such an increase. The objective of the variable limit  
is to increase the amount of coverage in tandem with the annual increase in the inflation rate so as to prevent less than  
adequate coverage in the event of a loss. See also UNDERINSURANCE.  
VARIABLE PAY LIFE INSURANCE see VARIABLE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE.  
VARIABLE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE policy that allows premium payments to vary, within certain limits, at the  
option of the policyholder. In return, the death benefit and rate of cash value accumulation vary with the premium  
payments. UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE is the most common type of policy offering variable premiums. See also  
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM LIFE INSURANCE.

LIFE POLICY.

VESTED BENEFIT entitlement of a PARTICIPANT in an EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE PLAN to receive  
benefits regardless of his or her employment status. See also VESTING.  
VESTED INTEREST see VESTING.  
VESTING entitlement of a pension plan participant (employee) to receive full benefits at NORMAL RETIREMENT  
AGE, or a reduced benefit upon EARLY RETIREMENT, whether or not the participant still works for the same  
employer. The EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) mandates vesting under  
one of these rules:  
1. FORTY-FIVE YEAR RULE  
2. FIVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR RULE  
3. TEN YEAR RULE  
On January 1, 1989, under the TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986, the above vesting requirements were replaced with the  
following:  
< previous page page_550 next page >  
 
< previous page page_551 next page >  
Page 551  
1. full vesting (100%) after a participant completes five years of service with an employer; or  
2. vesting of 20% after completion of three years of service with an employer, increasing by 20% for each year of  
service thereafter, until 100% vesting is achieved at the end of seven years of service.  
VESTING, CONDITIONAL limitation under a contributory pension plan of an employee's right to receive vested  
benefits. The employee can withdraw contributions to the pension plan only according to stated conditions. See also  
VESTING.  
VESTING, DEFERRED specified requirements of minimum age and years of service to be met by an employee before  
the individual's benefits are vested. For example, under the TEN YEAR VESTING rule, an employee must work ten  
years for the particular employer before benefits vest. See also VESTING, IMMEDIATE.  
VESTING, FULL see FULL VESTING.  
VESTING, IMMEDIATE employee's full entitlement, with no waiting period, to benefits under a pension or retirement  
plan. In the case of a CONTRIBUTORY plan, there is immediate vesting of the employee's own contributions, plus the  
earnings attributable to those contributions. As to employer contributions in contributory and NONCONTRIBUTORY  
plans, VESTING depends on the terms of the plans, although maximum time limits for full vesting are set by law. Some  
plans provide immediate vesting of employer contributions in the case of death or disability. SIMPLIFIED  
EMPLOYEE PENSION (SEP) plans require immediate vesting of employer contributions. See also TAX REFORM  
ACT OF 1986; VESTING.  
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA) U.S. government agency that administers life insurance, health insurance,  
welfare, mortgage loans, education, pension benefits, and other programs for veterans of the U.S. armed forces.  
VETERANS GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (VGLI) five-year nonrenewable TERM LIFE INSURANCE policy for  
veterans who were covered by SERVICEMENS GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (SEGLI) while on active duty in the U.S.  
uniformed forces. At the end of the five-year term, the insured may convert the policy to individual permanent life  
insurance with any company that participates in the VGLI program.  
VIATICAL SETTLEMENT act by a person who is terminally ill of cashing in a life insurance policy to pay for the  
necessary associated illness, medical expenses, and final wishes. This terminally ill person contacts a viatical agent who  
bids the life insurance policy on the terminally ill person to the many VIATICAL SETTLEMENT COMPANIES.  
The package that is sent out for bids includes the terms of the life insurance policy as well as the medical prognosis of  
the terminally ill  
< previous page page_551 next page >  
 
< previous page page_552 next page >  
Page 552  
person. The viatical settlement company that is awarded the bid agrees to pay 50% to 80% of the FACE AMOUNT of  
the policy, varying according to the gravity of the terminally ill person's condition and LIFE EXPECTANCY. In turn,  
the viatical settlement company sells the terminally ill person's life insurance policy to an investor who then becomes  
the POLICYHOLDER as well as the BENEFICIARY and assumes payment of the premiums of the policy. Upon the  
death of the terminally ill person, the investor will receive 100% of the life insurance policy's face amount from the  
insurance company. The sooner the terminally ill patient dies, the higher the investor's return. While returns of 15% to  
20% are typical for investors, the policies can pay off a substantially higher return if death occurs early.  
VIATICAL SETTLEMENT COMPANY company that buys life insurance policies from policyowners on the lives of  
insureds who are terminally ill. This type of company pays cash for the life insurance policies, usually in the range of  
50% to 80% of the FACE AMOUNT. It also pays the premiums due and receives the DEATH BENEFIT when that  
person dies. Policies are purchased when the terminally ill person has 24 months or less to live.  
VIATICATION process under which terminally ill people sell their life insurance policy for value thereby excluding the  
policy from being subject to the transfer for value under the three-year rule.

prescriptions.  
VIS MAJOR Latin phrase meaning "overpowering force"; an unavoidable accident or calamity; an accident for which  
no one is responsible; an ACT OF GOD.  
VOIDABLE CONTRACT VALID CONTRACT that can be canceled for cause by one or more parties to the contract.  
An insurance contract can be voided by the insurer if the insured has used fraudulent means to obtain it or has  
intentionally concealed information or misrepresented the risk.  
VOID CONTRACT apparent agreement that is not a valid contract.  
VOLUNTARY ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT (AD&D) INSURANCE additional amount of  
ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT INSURANCE not provided by the employee benefit plan  
(standard group life plan) that may be chosen by the employee. Generally, the employee pays the entire premium that is  
deducted through the employer's payroll deduction accounting system used for other employee benefit plans.

Page 553  
VOLUNTARY COMPENSATION ENDORSEMENT addition to a WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE  
policy to cover payments to injured employees who are not covered by a state's workers compensation law. This  
endorsement provides employees who are not covered by the state law a choice of receiving WORKERS  
COMPENSATION BENEFITS or suing the employer. Under workers compensation laws, employers agree to supply,  
according to a formula, income lost by workers accidentally injured on the job, as well as medical and rehabilitation  
benefits and death and survivor benefits. In exchange, these benefits are to be the final obligation of the employer to  
compensate workers, or the exclusive remedy. However, there has been considerable erosion of the exclusive remedy  
concept since the early 1970s. Workers have been allowed to sue their employers for various types of on-the-job  
injuries. Each state has its own workers compensation law.  
VOLUNTARY DEDUCTIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION PLAN pension plan that allows an employee to  
contribute by electing to have money deducted from each paycheck. Some qualified plans such as 401 (k) allow  
employees to contribute pre-tax dollars, while others require employees to put in after-tax dollars.  
VOLUNTARY DEFERRAL PLAN vehicle for the deferring of unneeded current income for a later date, such as  
retirement, providing the following benefits:  
1. There is no tax on earnings of the plan until distributed.  
2. Employee is able to defer compensation in excess of the amount subject to the limitations of qualified plans since the  
voluntary plan is a nonqualified plan.  
3. The amount the employee defers can be matched by the employer.  
4. The employer and employee have flexibility in designing BENEFITS and VESTING requirements.  
5. The employer can select employees to participate in the plan since it is a nonqualified plan and does not have to  
comply with the antidiscrimination provisions of qualified plans found under the EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT  
INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).  
6. Life insurance can be used as the funding instrument and, as such, the employer can receive the death benefit, thereby  
recovering its matching contribution to the plan.  
VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEES BENEFICIARY ASSOCIATION (VEBA) tax-exempt entity as qualified under Section  
501 (c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. The VEBA usually provides its members and their dependents and  
beneficiaries with paid life insurance, health insurance, and accident insurance. The VEBA can be established by any  
employer for employees even if they already have a retirement plan. Employers are permitted to make tax-deductible  
contributions to the VEBA that is usually established as a trust with the bank acting as a trustee. Earnings build within  
the trust on a tax-deferred basis. If the VEBA should terminate, all of the VEBA's assets are distributed to  
< previous page page_553 next page >  
 
< previous page page_554 next page >  
Page 554  
the active participants in the VEBA as of the date of termination. Distributions to a VEBA participant are not required  
to begin by age 70 1/2 , nor is a penalty charged if the distributions begin prior to age 59 1/2. Survivor benefits are  
received on an income and estate tax-free basis. Assets of the VEBA are exempt from creditors' claims. The IRS code  
requires that the VEBA must have at least two participants (one of the participants can be a spouse); benefits must be  
based on annual compensation as well as age; and all full-time employees who are at least age 21 and have at least three  
years of full-time service must be allowed to participate. The employer can terminate the plan at any time.  
VOLUNTARY GOVERNMENT INSURANCE see SOCIAL INSURANCE.  
VOLUNTARY INSURANCE see SOCIAL INSURANCE.  
VOLUNTARY LIFE INSURANCE additional amount of life insurance above that provided by the employee benefit  
plan (standard group life plan) that may be chosen by the employee. A limit is usually placed on this maximum and is  
expressed as a multiple of the employee's earnings.  
VOLUNTARY PAYROLL DEDUCTION PLAN program through which employees purchase individual LIFE  
INSURANCE and DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE by having the employer reduce their income by the required  
insurance PREMIUM. Since the policies are individual policies, paid for totally by the employees, the policies are  
portable and not a function of employment.  
VOLUNTARY PLAN TERMINATION ending a pension plan at the election of an employer or sponsor. The employer  
has the unilateral right to change or terminate a pension plan at any time. However, the termination must meet  
requirements set out by the EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). Assets must  
be distributed to participants according to federal guidelines.  
VOLUNTARY RESERVE amount established by an insurance company, but not required by state law, for any of a  
number of reasons, such as a reserve for payment of future dividends. A voluntary reserve is likely to appear as a  
LIABILITY on the company's balance sheet. Contrast with STATUTORY RESERVES. See also BALANCE SHEET  
RESERVES; POLICY RESERVE.  
VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997 act in which volunteers of nonprofit organizations and government  
entities do not incur liability if they are acting within the scope of their volunteer activities, their actions do not result in  
reckless misconduct, gross negligence, and/or willful or criminal misconduct, and they have the proper license, if  
required. Protection is only for individual volunteers; there is no protection for organizations or paid members of  
organizations.

VOLUNTEER PROTECTION LAWS laws enacted by all of the 50 states whose purpose it is to reduce or eliminate the  
volunteer's CIVIL LIABILITY exposure. An ideal law would exclude the volunteer from civil liability resulting from  
actions taken within the volunteer's official capacity unless the damage and/or injury caused was the result of a willful  
act by the volunteer.  
VOYAGE POLICY OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE covering one trip. Ocean marine insurance is written either for a  
specific time period or per trip. A voyage policy is usually written for cargo, whereas a time policy covers a ship.

W 
WAGE INDEX table used, among other purposes, to determine monthly Social Security benefit for a retired or disabled  
worker and his or her dependents. The AVERAGE MONTHLY WAGE (AMW) of the worker is computed,  
disregarding certain periods of low earnings. The AMW is used to determine the PRIMARY INSURANCE AMOUNT  
(PIA). Then, benefits are figured from the table depending on how old the worker is upon retirement, whether there are  
dependents or survivors, and when they will retire.  
WAGERING V. INSURANCE common misunderstanding about insurance. In gambling a RISK is created that did not  
exist prior to placing a bet. Under insurance, a risk exists whether or not an insurance policy is purchased. For example,  
the uncertainty of one's home burning exists independent of the purchase of insurance; the purchase of insurance should  
not affect the probability of loss.  
WAITING PERIOD see DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE (ELIMINATION PERIOD).  
WAIVE see WAIVER; WAIVER OF INVENTORY CLAUSE; WAIVER OF PREMIUM (WP); WAIVER OF  
PREMIUM FOR PAYER BENEFIT; WAIVER OF RESTORATION PREMIUM; WAIVER OF SUBROGATION  
RIGHTS CLAUSE.  
WAIVER relinquishment of a legal right to act. For example, an insured relies on statements of an agent of an insurance  
company concerning coverages under an insurance policy. Agents by their actions may have waived certain provisions  
the insurance company has written in the insurance policy, with the company's authority. Another example would be the  
provision in the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY that suspends coverage if a hazard is increased by the actions  
of an insured. An insured who stores explosives near the family home notifies the insurance company; the company  
grants permission to do so, thereby waiving its defense of the increase in hazard clause.  
WAIVER OF COINSURANCE CLAUSE provision in property insurance that stipulates that the COINSURANCE  
REQUIREMENT will not be in effect.  
WAIVER OF INVENTORY CLAUSE provision in property insurance that waives, under specified circumstances, the  
requirement for an inventory of undamaged property when a damage claim is filed. A COINSURANCE clause in a fire  
insurance policy typically requires such an inventory or appraisal at the time of a claim. The waiver avoids the expense  
of an inventory when the claim is small. Under one common formula, the inventory requirement is waived when the  
claim is for less than $10,000 and is also for less than 5% of the limit of all insurance coverage applicable to the  
property.

WAIVER OF PREMIUM FOR DISABILITY see RIDERS, LIFE POLICIES.  
WAIVER OF PREMIUM FOR PAYER BENEFIT clause added to an insurance policy providing WAIVER OF  
PREMIUM (WP) if the premium payer dies or becomes disabled. For example, this option is available on insurance  
policies on a child's life where the premium is paid by an adult, or on life and health policies for adults.  
WAIVER OF PREMIUM RIDER see WAIVER OF PREMIUM (WP).  
WAIVER OF PREMIUM (WP) in life insurance, action by an insurance company canceling premium payments by an  
insured who has been disabled for at least six months. The policy remains in force and continues to build cash values  
and pay dividends (if it is a participating policy), just as if the insured was still making premium payments. Experts  
suggest that this clause should be considered in a life insurance policy since the probability of becoming disabled is 7 to  
10 times greater than death at younger or middle ages.  
WAIVER OF RESTORATION PREMIUM clause in a SURETY BOND contract providing for restoration of coverage  
after a loss without requirement of a RESTORATION PREMIUM.  
WAIVER OF SUBROGATION RIGHTS CLAUSE endorsement to a property liability policy whereby an insurer gives  
up the right to take action against a third party for a loss suffered by an insured. Typically, under terms of the  
SUBROGATION CLAUSE, the insurer, having paid an insured for a loss, takes over any rights possessed by the  
insured who has suffered the loss. For example, an insured, John Smith, is hit by another car while he is driving. His  
insurance company pays his claim and then may sue or attempt to recover damages from the other driver. In certain  
instances, the insured might want to get a waiver of subrogation rights from the insurer. For example, if a landlord  
assured a tenant that the tenant was not responsible for damage to the landlord's property, the landlord could make good  
on that promise only by getting the insurer to waive its subrogation rights. Otherwise, if the land-lord's property was  
damaged by the tenant, the insurer would have to pay the claim and could then try to collect damages from the tenant.  
WANTON DISREGARD legal phrase used in NEGLIGENCE cases to describe one person's overwhelming lack of  
care for the rights or wellbeing of another. Wanton disregard of another's rights is evidence of GROSS NEGLIGENCE.  
WAR DAMAGE INSURANCE CORPORATION government reinsurance program that provided coverage for U.S.  
properties during World War II. Private insurers shared the first layer of coverage, with the government providing  
catastrophic loss coverage. This is one of several government insurance programs for exposures that private insurers  
cannot cover because techniques of spreading the risk do not apply.

WAREHOUSE BOND type of surety bond that guarantees that goods stored in a warehouse will be delivered upon  
presentation of a receipt.  
WAREHOUSERS LIABILITY FORM special insurance that covers warehousers liability to customers whose property  
is damaged by an insured peril while in the custody of an insured warehouser. Policy deductibles may range from $50 to  
$10,000. Typical exclusions are war risks, money, securities, and spoilage of perishable goods.  
WAREHOUSE-TO-WAREHOUSE CLAUSE part of an ocean marine policy that provides coverage of goods through  
all of the stages of a journey. Coverage begins when goods leave the warehouse of a shipper, and continues until they  
reach the customer's warehouse.  
WAR EXCLUSION CLAUSE provision in a life insurance policy that death benefits will not be paid in the event an  
insured dies from warrelated causes; or in lieu of a death benefit there is a return of premiums plus interest, or a refund  
equal to the reserve portion (cash value) of the policy. For example, during the Vietnam War, if a whole life policy with  
a war exclusion clause had a face amount of $10,000 and an insured died as the result of war-related injuries, the  
beneficiary would receive the cash value of the policy. This clause cannot be added to a policy that had none originally.  
If it is included in a policy bought in time of war, it is typically removed by life insurance companies at the end of the  
war and, once removed, can never be restored.  
WARN see WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT (WARN).  
WAR PERIL see WAR RISK INSURANCE.  
WARRANTY pledge by an insured in writing, and a part of the actual contract, that a particular condition exists or does  
not exist. For example, an insured warrants that a sprinkler system works. In exchange, the insurance company charges  
a reduced premium for fire coverage. Statements by an insured in an application for property insurance are deemed to  
be warranties, not representations, as is generally the case in life insurance policy applications. See also  
REPRESENTATIONS.  
WAR RISKS exposures usually excluded from life and health insurance, or subject to a maximum limit if covered. For  
property coverage, see WAR RISK INSURANCE.  
WAR RISK INSURANCE coverage for damage due to peril of war, usually written as part of an OCEAN MARINE  
INSURANCE policy.  
WASHINGTON, D.C. V. GREATER WASHINGTON BOARD OF TRADE legal decision in which the Supreme  
Court of the United States ruled that states cannot require employers to provide disabled employees the same health  
insurance with which they provide active employees. Regulation by states of EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INSURANCE  
PLANS is precluded when it relates in any way to employee benefit  
< previous page page_558 next page >  
 
< previous page page_559 next page >  
Page 559  
plans governed by the federal statute on pensions and benefits (EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY  
ACT OF 1974ERISA). The issue in this case was the relationship between WORKERS COMPENSATION  
INSURANCE (as required by the states for job-related illness or injuries incurred by the employee) and federally  
regulated health insurance provided by the company for actively at work employees. The Greater Washington Board of  
Trade challenged the Washington,  
D.C. law that required employers who provide health insurance for actively at-work employees to continue to offer  
equivalent health insurance coverage to disabled employees who are eligible for work-ers compensation insurance.  
WASH SALE RULE rule concerning stock sold and then repurchased or a similar security repurchased (warrants or  
options) within 30 full days before or after the day of the sale. Losses established from such a sale cannot be used to  
offset capital gains for tax purposes; however, this disallowed loss is not lost forever, as it can be added to the cost basis  
of the repurchased security for tax purposes.  
WATERCRAFT ENDORSEMENT addition to the HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY AND COMMERCIAL  
PACKAGE POLICY that provides liability and medical coverage for damages resulting from the operation of motor  
boats too large to qualify for insurance under homeowners and commercial package policies.  
WATERCRAFT NONOWNED INSURANCE endorsement to COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY  
INSURANCE (CGL) for a business responsible for boats it does not own. Whether the boats are leased from another  
firm or owned by employees who operate them for the benefit of the business owner, a business has a liability exposure  
that is not covered by a CGL policy; the special endorsement is needed for this coverage.  
WATER DAMAGE INSURANCE protection in the event of accidental discharge, leakage, or overflow of water from  
plumbing systems, heating, air conditioning, and refrigerating systems, and rain or snow through broken doors, open  
doors, windows, and skylights resulting in damage or destruction of the property scheduled in the policy. This type of  
water damage coverage can also be acquired through an endorsement of a standard property insurance policy.  
WATER DAMAGE LEGAL LIABILITY INSURANCE coverage for an insured's liability for damage to another's  
property from leakage or overflow of water. Some liability policies specifically exclude water damage, including that  
caused by rain or snow. Therefore, a special policy was necessary to cover this exposure. However, most liability  
policies today have dropped this exclusion, and coverage for water damage liability is part of the regular liability policy.  
WATER EXCLUSION CLAUSE provision in many property insurance policies that excludes coverage for floods and  
backup from sewers or  
< previous page page_559 next page >  
 
< previous page page_560 next page >  
Page 560  
drains and underground water. Because floods and hurricanes are generally confined to certain areas, only policyholders  
in those areas need flood insurance. Therefore, it is impossible for underwriters to spread the risk, which is the basis of  
underwriting. But because homeowners in the endangered areas need insurance, the U.S. government developed a  
special FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE program.  
WATER POLLUTION LIABILITY obligations of shipowners for water polluted by spills from their ships. If a ship  
discharges oil or other polluting or hazardous substances into the water, the shipowner is responsible either for  
removing them, paying for their removal, or, if the substances cannot be removed, paying a fine. Following passage of  
the WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1970 establishing the liability of shipowners, marine underwriters  
formed the WATER QUALITY INSURANCE SYNDICATE to provide insurance.  
WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1970 federal law that requires shipowners to clean up or pay for the  
cleanup of waters polluted by discharges from their ships. Shipowners may be refused navigation privileges if they  
cannot demonstrate that they have the financial resources to pay for cleanups.  
WATER QUALITY INSURANCE SYNDICATE group of marine underwriters formed in 1971 to provide coverage for  
shipowners for WATER POLLUTION LIABILITY. The federal WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1970  
made shipowners responsible for hazardous substances discharged by their ships into the water. This led to the Water  
Quality Insurance Syndicate. Coverage extends to liabilities imposed by states. The syndicate vouches for the financial  
responsibility of those it insures.  
WEAR AND TEAR EXCLUSION denial of coverage for damage, in INLAND MARINE insurance, stemming from  
routine use of the property. Property can be expected to deteriorate somewhat over time from normal use. This is not  
considered an insurable loss.  
WEATHER INSURANCE see RAIN INSURANCE.  
WEDDING PRESENTS FLOATER personal property insurance that provides ALL-RISKS coverage for wedding  
presents, wherever they may be in the world, until they are permanently located. Because the new owners of wedding  
presents may not yet have a home or a HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY, and because their gifts may be moved  
from place to place until they are settled, this policy fills a gap in coverage, but it can be purchased only for as long as  
90 days following the wedding.  
WEEKLY PREMIUM INSURANCE see DEBIT INSURANCE (HOME SERVICE INSURANCE, INDUSTRIAL  
INSURANCE).  
WEIGHT OF ICE, SNOW, OR SLEET INSURANCE coverage for damage to a building or its contents due to the  
weight of these elements. Outdoor property such as patios, swimming pools, and sidewalks are usually excluded.

WELFARE AND PENSION PLANS DISCLOSURE ACT federal law that requires administrators of pension plans  
with more than 25 participants to file a plan description with the U.S. Department of Labor. A plan description includes  
schedules of benefits, type of administration, and copies of the plan. If the plan has more than 100 participants, the  
administrator must also file an annual financial report. This information must be made available to plan participants  
upon request, and the person responsible for handling the funds must be bonded.  
WELLNESS PROGRAM employee benefit program that emphasizes the pursuit of a lifestyle that minimizes the  
occurrence of sickness through an organized program of preventive medicine. Such a program includes screening for  
high blood pressure, obesity, breast cancer, and stress; a smoke-free workplace; a systematized exercise and fitness  
approach for general health; and training and education programs for employees concerning proper nutrition, stress  
management, weight control, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and prenatal care.

WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE see ORDINARY LIFE INSURANCE.  
WHOLESALE INSURANCE see FRANCHISE INSURANCE (WHOLESALE INSURANCE).  
WHOLESALE LIFE INSURANCE variation of GROUP LIFE INSURANCE that covers a small group of persons who  
work for the same employer. With group life insurance, the employer owns the policy; with wholesale insurance, each  
employee applies for and owns his or her own policy. However, the employer must agree to pay at least part of  
wholesale life insurance premiums for the group to qualify for wholesale insurance. Wholesale insurance was devised  
for groups as small as 10 persons when group insurance was limited by law to a minimum of 50 members. Today, group  
insurance is sold to smaller groups and wholesale insurance is written for groups as small as five persons. See also  
FRANCHISE INSURANCE (WHOLESALE INSURANCE).  
WHOLESALING action in which an insurance company develops an insurance product and sells that product to a third  
party (usually financial advisors such as accountants, lawyers, and/or bankers) who add their own commissions and/or  
fees to that product, and resell that product to their clients.

WILL usually a written document stipulating the disposition of one's assets at death. If this document does not exist at  
death, the assets are distributed according to state law. This document should include the following central points: (1)  
name of individual who is to be responsible for carrying out the wishes of the deceased; (2) name of guardian for any  
minor children; (3) two notarized signatures of two witnesses; (4) requirements for the disposition of property; and (5)  
establishment of state of residence. This is of particular importance if there is ownership of property in different states.  
WINDOW GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACT (GIC) type of GUARANTEED INVESTMENT  
CONTRACT (GIC) under which a series of payments are made into an account (usually monthly to reflect the  
frequency of the employee's salary) of an insurance company where it will remain for a stipulated number of years.  
Both the principal of the account and the interest rate are guaranteed by the insurance company. At an agreed upon  
future date, both principal and interest are returned to the payor (usually a DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN).  
WINDSTORM HAZARD see STORM INSURANCE (WINDSTORM INSURANCE).  
WINDSTORM INSURANCE additional coverage available on most property insurance policies through the  
EXTENDED COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT. Windstorms, including hurricanes, cyclones, and high winds, are not  
among the covered perils under most property insurance policies. See also STORM INSURANCE (WINDSTORM  
INSURANCE).  
WISCONSIN STATE LIFE FUND life insurance distribution system under which the state underwrites and sells life  
insurance to any resident of Wisconsin who makes application.  
WINTER RANGE FORM type of livestock insurance that covers for cattle and sheep on the range from October 1 to  
May 1 in the Western states. Perils insured against are the weather, including freezing; most natural disasters; riot and  
civil commotion; collision with vehicles; and theft.

WOOL GROWERS FLOATER INLAND MARINE policy addition that provides coverage to owners of sheep, and to  
warehouseowners who store wool as well as wool in transit.  
WORK AND MATERIALS CLAUSE provision in most property insurance policies that permits a policyholder to use  
the insured premises to store materials and handle them in the manner needed to pursue his or her line of business.  
Without this clause, a policy may be voided for fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation of an undisclosed  
INCREASED HAZARD. The clause provides a defense for a policyholder against a charge of increasing the hazard of a  
workplace if the materials in question are necessary to the business.  
WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT (WARN) federal law, effective February 4,  
1989, that requires company notification of employees prior to laying them off or closing a plant or an office. Workers  
covered under WARN are to include office workers, field representatives, agents, managers, and any other employees  
of insurance companies. To be affected by WARN, the company must employ at least 100 full-time employees. Parttime  
employees are not included in the 100 full-time employees count unless the total hours worked per week by all  
employees is at least 4000 hours. WARN requires the company to notify its employees of impending layoffs when one  
or more of the following circumstances occur:  
1. At least 500 employees are terminated or laid off during a 30-day period.  
2. At least 50 employees are terminated or laid off, comprising at least 33% of the total employment force, during a 30-  
day period.  
3. A plant or an office is closed, whether on a temporary or permanent basis.  
WORKERS COMPENSATION see WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE.  
WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS income, medical, rehabilitation, death, and survivor payments to workers  
injured on the job. State workers compensation laws, which date from early in the twentieth century, provide that  
employers take responsibility for on-the-job injuries. Each state defines the benefit level for employers in that state.  
Although these benefits were designed to be the final obligation of employers to their employees, there has been  
considerable erosion of this concept since the early 1970s; workers have been allowed by the courts to sue employers  
for various on-the-job injuries in addition to workers compensation benefits. Because workers compensation benefits  
are a routine and fairly predictable risk, many employers use SELF INSURANCE. Some states mandate that employers  
buy workers  
< previous page page_563 next page >  
 
< previous page page_564 next page >  
Page 564  
compensation insurance from a state fund, but some offer a choice of a state fund, self insurance, or commercial  
insurance.  
WORKERS COMPENSATION CATASTROPHE COVER excess coverage for employers who use SELF  
INSURANCE for routine workers compensation risks. Many employers consider workers compensation exposure to be  
routine and predictable and set up a fund to pay these losses themselves rather than trade premium and claims dollars  
with an insurance company. To supplement a self-insurance program, an employer may buy insurance for catastrophic  
loss above a certain limit. A stop loss aggregate contract will pay all losses in one year over a specified dollar limit. A  
SPECIFIC EXCESS CONTRACT pays losses over a stated limit per accident.  
WORKERS COMPENSATION, COVERAGE A agreement under which an insurance company promises to pay all  
compensation and all benefits required of an insured employer under the workers compensation act of the state or states  
listed in the policy.  
WORKERS COMPENSATION, COVERAGE B coverage under a commercial workers compensation policy for  
situations in which an employee not covered under workers compensation laws could sue for injuries suffered under  
common law liability.  
WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE coverage providing four types of benefits (medical care, death,  
disability, rehabilitation) for employee job-related injuries or diseases as a matter of right (without regard to fault). This  
insurance is usually purchased by the employer from an insurance company, although in a few states there are  
monopolistic state funds through which the insurance must be purchased. The premium rate is based on a percentage of  
the employer's payroll and varies according to the employee's occupation. See also WORKERS COMPENSATION  
BENEFITS.  
WORLD INSURANCE see WORLDWIDE COVERAGE.  
WORLDWIDE COVERAGE endorsement to the COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE (CGL)  
policy that provides liability coverage to an insured business for damages anywhere in the world. Policies typically have  
territorial limits for liability coverage, but this endorsement extends coverage worldwide, so long as a damage suit is  
brought in the U.S. or Canada.  
WORLD WIDE WEB interconnection of computers that contain pages classified into groups called web sites that can  
be accessed over the INTERNET. The only requirement for visiting a web site is to have access to the Internet through  
the software of a BROWSER.  
WORRY state of anxiety and distress. One goal of adequate insurance is to eliminate, or alleviate, worry on the part of a  
policyholder. Many people, for example, are concerned that they would not be able to  
< previous page page_564 next page >  
 
< previous page page_565 next page >  
Page 565  
handle the financial burden if they became ill, or that their spouse would be impoverished if they died. Insurance is  
designed to eliminate these concerns by assuring that benefits will be provided.  
WRAP-AROUND INSURANCE PROGRAM program designed as protection for political risk (action taken by a  
foreign government resulting in financial loss to companies trading or investing overseas). Coverage is provided for  
deprivation, acts of government, embargo, sanction, partial loss, and forced abandonment.  
WRAP-UP INSURANCE liability policy that covers all liability exposures for a large group that has something in  
common. For example, wrap-up insurance can be written for all the various businesses working together on a special  
project, to provide coverage for losses arising out of that work only.  
WRIGHT, ELIZUR Massachusetts commissioner of insurance responsible for the passage of legislation (1861) that  
guaranteed policyowners of that state equity in the cash value of their life insurance. The nonforfeiture legislation  
stipulated that four-fifths of the cash value of a life insurance policy be applied to the purchase of extended term life  
insurance.  
WRITE to sell a specific amount of insurance.  
WRITTEN BUSINESS insurance for which (1) an application has been filed but the first premium has not yet been paid  
or (2) a life insurance policy that has not yet been delivered to an insured.  
WRITTEN PREMIUMS total premiums generated from all policies written by an insurance company within a given  
period of time. See also EARNED PREMIUM.  
WRONGFUL ACT error, misstatement, or breach of duty by an officer or director of a company that results in a lawsuit  
against the company. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE covers claims arising from wrongful  
acts by directors or officers of a company while in that capacity. Wrongful acts specifically exclude dishonesty, theft,  
libel, and slander. During the liability insurance crisis of the 1980s, this type of coverage became unavailable in many  
industries as wrongful acts received an increasingly liberal interpretation by the courts and many expensive lawsuits  
were filed against business firms. See also TORT; TORT, DEFENSE AGAINST UNINTENTIONAL; TORT,  
INTENTIONAL; TORT, UNINTENTIONAL.  
WRONGFUL DEATH death caused by a person without legal justification. Wrongful death may be the result of  
negligence, such as when a drunken driver hits and kills someone; or it may be intentional, as when someone kills  
another person with a gun. In most states, suits can be filed for damages caused by wrongful death. Much work has been  
done in an attempt to put a value on human life and, therefore, to

determine the compensation allowable to the family of an individual who has been killed. See also HUMAN LIFE  
VALUE APPROACH (ECONOMIC VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIFEEVOIL).  
WRONGFUL TERMINATION CLAIM under a general liability policy, a claim by an employer arising when an  
employee terminated by a supervisor without authority or just cause brings suit against the employer. Such a claim is  
covered under most general liability policies provided that the following elements are in evidence:  
1. the insurance policy is in force on the date of loss.  
2. there has been no willful misinterpretation of any material facts.  
3. the POLICYHOLDER did not have a willful (preconceived) intent to harm or injure the employee who was  
terminated.

XCU see EXPLOSION, COLLAPSE, AND UNDERGROUND EXCLUSION.  
YACHT INSURANCE coverage for fire and explosion, against fire and any damage caused by explosion whether or  
not fire ensues, and whether or not an explosion occurs on-or off-board; sinking from floating debris, sunken hulks, and  
reefs; stranding against sand bars and filled channels resulting in salvage costs, material and labor expenses to refloat  
and repair a yacht; collision causing legal liability for damage to another vessel; assailing thieves (theft by forcible  
entry); and jettison and barratry of mariners or masters. Coverage for liability for bodily injury and loss of life is  
available through OCEAN MARINE PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY INSURANCE.  
YEARLY PRICE OF PROTECTION METHOD ACTUARIAL procedure used to determine the cost of protection of a  
CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE policy on an annual basis. This cost of protection is developed by the following  
steps:  
1. Cash value at the beginning of the year plus the premiums paid in for that year are summed up, and the total is  
multiplied by an assumed interest rate factor of (1+i), resulting in the theoretical end of the year CASH SURRENDER  
VALUE;  
2. From the theoretical end of the year cash surrender value, the actual cash surrender value at the end of year and the  
dividends during that year are subtracted. The resultant figure is the sum allocated for MORTALITY CHARGES for  
that year;  
3. The sum allocated for mortality charges for that year is then divided by the AMOUNT OF RISK (face value end of  
the year cash surrender value) per $1000 of FACE AMOUNT.  
YEARLY PROBABILITY OF DYING figure in a MORTALITY TABLE derived by dividing the number of people  
dying during a given year by the number of people alive at the beginning of that same year.  
YEARLY PROBABILITY OF LIVING figure in a MORTALITY TABLE derived by dividing the number of people  
alive at the end of a given year by the number of people alive at the beginning of that same year.  
YEARLY RATE OF RETURN METHOD ACTUARIAL procedure used to determine the annual rate of return at  
which annual benefits would have to be gained from the CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE policy in order to equal  
the annual investment made in the policy. The benefits under the policy are the CASH VALUE, dividends (if  
PARTICIPATING INSURANCE), and the DEATH BENEFIT for the year under discussion. The investment made in  
the policy is the amount of the premiums paid into the policy that year and the cash value at the beginning of that year.  
The equation then becomes:

This method was developed by Dr. Joseph Belth, a professor at Indiana University.  
YEARLY RENEWABLE GROUP TERM INSURANCE see GROUP TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
YEARLY RENEWABLE TERM (YRT) see RENEWABLE TERM LIFE INSURANCE.  
YEARLY RENEWABLE TERM PLAN OF REINSURANCE type of PROPORTIONAL REINSURANCE under  
which the CEDING COMPANY (PRIMARY INSURER) cedes to a REINSURER its NET AMOUNT AT RISK for the  
amount above its retention limit on a life insurance policy. In the event the insured dies, the reinsurer is obligated to pay  
that part of the death benefit which is equivalent to the net amount at risk.  
YEARS CERTAIN ANNUITY see LIFE ANNUITY CERTAIN.  
YEARS OF SERVICE length of employment as measured to determine eligibility, VESTING, and benefit levels for  
employee participants in tax qualified pension plans. There is often a requirement that years of service be continuous  
(without unexcused breaks).  
YIELD, CURRENT rate of return computed by dividing the current annual dividend (if a stock) or annual coupon  
amount (if a bond) by the amount paid for that financial instrument.  
YIELD OF ASSETS see YIELD ON ASSETS.  
YIELD ON ASSETS annual or other periodic rate of return on investments. Because life insurance companies act as  
custodians of premiums for many years, until money must be paid out in death benefits or other types of claims, they  
invest it to achieve a yield adequate to meet these obligations. Yield is also important to the policyowner of life policies  
that include a specific investment element. For example, some annuities and CASH VALUE LIFE INSURANCE  
policies pay a yield that approximates the market rate the policyholder could get elsewhere. While other contracts, such  
as a variable annuity and VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE do not guarantee a specified yield, they pay one based on  
the performance of the underlying investments.  
YIELD ON INVESTMENTS RATIO insurance company's net investment income divided by its invested assets. The  
greater the yield, the better the investments that are being made.  
YIELD RATE see YIELD ON ASSETS.  
YIELD TO MATURITY (YTM) sum total of the annual effective rate of return earned by an owner of a bond if that  
bond is held until its  
< previous page page_568 next page >  
 
< previous page page_569 next page >  
Page 569  
maturity date. This effective return includes the current income generated by the bond as well as any difference in the  
face value of the bond and the bond's purchase price. The relationship of YTM and the bond's coupon rate is as follows:  
(1) if the purchase price of the bond is greater than the face value of the bond (purchase made at a premium), the YTM  
is lower than the coupon rate (rate printed on bond certificate); (2) if the purchase price of the bond is less than the face  
value of the bond (purchase made at a discount), the YTM is higher than the coupon rate; and (3) if the purchase price  
of the bond is equal to the face value of the bond, the YTM is equal to the coupon rate. The equation for the  
computation of the YTM is as follows:  
YORK ANTWERP RULES treaty adopted by most major countries to determine adjustment for general average in

YRT see YEARLY RENEWABLE TERM (YRT).  
ZERO COUPON BONDS bonds that are sold at discount from their maturity value with the interest compounding and  
paid at the bond's maturity date. Even though these bonds do not pay interest until maturity, the interest that accrues  
each year becomes taxable income in that year. These bonds can be purchased to provide a specific sum of money at a  
specific date.

A measure of the severity or seriousness of losses, rather than the number of losses. It is measured in

Measures premiums and losses relating to accidents which occurred during a 12-month period.  
 
Accidental Bodily Injury.  
An injury sustained accidentally. Only the result need be accidental. Contrast with Accidental Means.  
 
Accidental Means.  
Unexpected or undesigned cause of an accidental bodily injury. Under a definition of accidental means,  
the mishap itself must be accidental, not just the resulting injury. An example would be an individual  
chopping wood: If the axe slipped out of his hand and cut his foot, it would have been accidental means.  
However, if his finger got in the way of the axe, it would not have been.

the insured. Contrast with Manuscript Policy.
